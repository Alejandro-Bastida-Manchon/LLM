                "comment": "Okay this post blew up really fast.... but i want to say i am thankful to the P.C.M.R community cause you guys are really supportive. i want to clarify on somethings and quench the curiosity of some. \n\n1.  This PC is built with parts shipped from the US and usually shipping is 1 to 1.5 months so i bought a lot of these parts during black Friday. The other thing is i don't use DHL to ship rather a company called [Bazebo.com](https://Bazebo.com) which has premises in the US and once i place an order with them they take care of the purchasing form the online retailer and shipping it to there warehouse in Uganda where i go to pick them up. So i am able to pay less for shipping as compared to DHL cause these guys ship in bulk weekly from the US to UG.\n\n2. We do have electricity in Uganda in fact my country exports electricity to nations like Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya\n\n3. We do have internet here in fact you can get all the way from 10mbps to 100mbps. it all depends on the ISP and how much you are willing to cash out. And when playing we usually connect to other servers not necessarily African Servers.\n\n4. The specs are Ryzen5 2600/Gigabyte Ds3h MOBO/ Rx580 4g/ 16gb of Ram/ 500w psu/ 500g ssd \n\n5. lastly you all must know that this isn't the first computer in Africa but i probably am the first to post to Reddit while disclosing my location. most of the people that built computer in my country love single player and aren't into online gaming mostly cause it cost a pretty penny to have internet. \n\nalright i guess i am done... thanks for the karma and the coins fellow members of the PCMR. i consider this a worthy Initiation",

They give you no chance at all to even contest it. Unless ofcourse you get a minimum of 10k upvotes on the wow/classicwow subreddit. So with that in mind, china must really have some sway over blizzards actions. It's just such a shame. Blizzard could have sided with the fans, lost a bit of that chinese money, but kept integrity and ended up earning more from the fans out of respect. Instead, they've lost their core fans, will end up getting less money from china, and less money from fans. They've really fucked themselves. Could have lost money, but not fans. Instead they've lost fans and money in the long run. So long blizz, and thanks for....... the few blizzard games that weren't just cash cow pieces of garbage.",

Western companies should be showing compassion toward the people who want democracy. The person they shamed has basically put his life on the line. China has a strong history of making dissidence disappear.\n\nBlizzard's actions are that of pure greed and lack of western social conscious.",

The employees that were helping me spent over 30 minutes looking around their store and the storage in the back while constantly apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nThen came the bad news: “There must’ve been a mistake when the i5s were listed as available online because we actually haven’t received any yet this week.”\n\nI was BUMMED out especially because I drove so far down for this—so close to finishing my first PC build. Then, the employee told me the good news: “We’d be happy to offer you the i7 processor for the same price as the i5. Again, really sorry for the inconvenience.”\n\nI was blown away. I am a Micro Center customer for life.",

We aren't providing entries as rewards for actions like following on social media. If you want to keep up to date with PCMR’s partners on social media, the buttons on the giveaway are there to make it easier for you.\n\n2. We want to make sure a member of PCMR wins, so the giveaway has a field for the Reddit name for that purpose. CORSAIR is only using that to verify a winner. If you don’t opt-in to the newsletter, your data will not be used for any advertising or marketing purposes.\n\nEdit 2 - Revised point one to make it more clear and in line with current rules.\n\nEDIT 3 - The contest has ended! Winner has been drawn, notified and has accepted the prize, announcement coming soon!\n\nEDIT 4 - CONGRATS TO /u/shadowcoll for being our GRAND PRIZE WINNER!\n\nAnd big congrats to /u/MrSneakMan_ /u/GlassOfOrange247 and /u/xOverly for being the runner up winners!

                "comment": "As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Filipe, boxing was a gentlemen’s game in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years, the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.\n\nIt was Filipe’s son, Andre Filipe Filipe, who developed what he called “the punching strategy” in 1637 after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down.\n\nWhen Andre Filipe Filipe challenged the then-champion, British ex-patriate “Sleepless” Bill Bishop to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favourite. You can imagine his surprise when while he was describing what he had had for breakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck, sending him down “for the count” in the parlance of our time.\n\nWhile it was universally agreed that the boy had violated the spirit of the game, officials were unable to find any actual rule that punching violated, and were forced to let the victory stand.\n\nThis upset caused an uproar in the boxing community large enough to spill over into local newspapers, and stirred the interest of many outsiders to come see what the fuss was about. The newcomers were enthralled to engage in these borderline barbaric displays of human strength and skill, and the rest is history – after a few spoilsport schoolmoms single-minded about safety added the padded gloves, of course.\n\nToday’s boxing enthusiasts fantasise about the newcomer that would rock the ring the way Filipe did.\n\nClassification of the modern ruleset has essentially locked the punching strategy into place; but it’s easy to get caught up in the fantasy. Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis. And though they’ve achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big-time.\n\nThe real wonder, though, is that Andre Filipe’s original vision of boxing is still around. Gentlemen’s boxing clubs can be found in cities all over the world; you can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite gentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.\n\nMost people only come to watch a few hours of a match, and then leave. But every once in a while you’ll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a die-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Filipe and Bishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious seconds of wakefulness slip away, only to return to fight again another day.",

The camera doesn't really help to mask this issue and almost seems to draw attention to it. \n\nThe models look uncannily like animatronic stuffed versions of their actual counterparts. \n\nThe environments don't look natural, with inconsistent details and object placement. Some areas look appropriately dense and natural, others (Like with the mantis & clovers) look highly artificial. \n\nThe only thing I can see in this is traversal and some semblance of survival mechanics? Is that really a good fit for a story based adventure game? \n\nI'm reminded of the Humankind game, except that used survival mechanics quite sparingly and removed focus on them over time as your goals change as the species progresses. It also was about pushing boundaries, exploring, and avoiding then overcoming huge dangers through generations. Any story was very sparse, abstract, and system driven and combat was almost deliberately bare and ruthless. It also just looked a hell of a lot better. That game only had modest commercial success yet was from experienced developers. It was more of an experiment. This sounds, by your descriptions and what I'm seeing, derivative of some popular concepts and put together using bought assets. \n\nI'm being really harsh, but that's what I'm thinking of. This looks like a slapping together of assets with a pitch to its systems that sounds almost remarkably uninspired. How do you expect a story about animals to emotionally resonate? Is a combat system appropriate for such a small team with a diverse set of animals appropriate, skill trees too? How does that service your main pitch?\n\nI don't know what people are seeing in this.",
