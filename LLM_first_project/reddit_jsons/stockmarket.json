Ironically McKinley was shot during a public speech he was giving laying out a departure from his high tariffing policies, rejection of protectionism, and a new fondness for free trade. \n\nEven back then tariffs were strongly opposed and used on the campaign trail to great effect by democratic candidates back in 1890. McKinley lost his seat over it, it was a landslide year for the Democratic Party.",

And the House burned all of its political capital to squeeze by a disaster of a bill. The only way they could tell everyone it was going to be paid for was by tariffs and cuts. Tariffs just got taken out. \n\nThe funny part is it doesn’t really matter what they do — ie attempt to ignore it or get a stay and tie it up in the courts or comply (no way, that’s not their style, but it’s not impossible — in any case, it’s moot). The signal has been sent, the king has been shown to bleed. \n\nStocks may rip, but I think it will be short-lived; I’d be more willing to say bonds crash as lenders realize this will get tied up in the courts and scare off any chance of the Senate passing it in the aftermath of this disaster. It’s DOA. That’s not even considering the astronomical domestic business pressure they’re already certainly feeling as businesses across the country now have a legal decision to exempt them from anything the administration tries to do now. It’s weak but enough of a safe bet to plan around for a business leader, owner, operator to make decisions.\n\nAs for the geopolitical situation, I’d imagine there are a good number of reasons for the world to feel the bully who threatened so much to so many shouldn’t be made to atone for its hubris. Supply chains have been dramatically disrupted and reoriented and our debt and dollar depend on the world we disrespected and threatened feeling that we are trustworthy debtors and agreeable partners. The domestic factors already mentioned strongly suggest both of these tenets have been violated in scarring and long lasting ways. Enough of the world has started to meaningfully question American exceptionalism and to put (or rather begin moving) their money where their mouth is — demanding higher yields on Treasuries, the Taiwanese dollar spike, foreign currency and equity market record appreciation… you get the idea. This gives them the signal they need to begin offloading our debt based on the same risk assessment that domestic businesses are playing. There’s no way for them to fund this now and everyone now knows it can’t be furnished by force from anywhere except inside the country itself. Our debt “crisis” is now an actual crisis.",

                "comment": "Even though the Court ruled Trump’s global tariffs under IEEPA invalid, that does not stop him from using a different law, \\[Section 301\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section\\_301\\_of\\_the\\_Trade\\_Act\\_of\\_1974) of Trade Act (1974).\n\n\n\nSection 301 gives the President, through the USTR, broad authority to impose tariffs on any country that engages in what the USTR calls an unfair trade practice. Trump used this procedure to impose tariffs on China in his first term.\n\n\n\nWhat counts as unfair is vague, and the bar is very low. Every country is guilty of something. Trump can easily direct the USTR to find unfair practices against any country he wants. Furthermore, the head of the USTR is \\*\\*Trump appointed\\*\\*. It does not matter if the claim is weak because the courts do not review whether the trade practice is really unfair, only checking if USTR followed the basic procedural steps.\n\n\n\nTrump controls the USTR, so he can order multiple investigations, launching cases against China, the EU, Canada, etc. This allows him to rebuild a global tariff regime in a matter of months. The only difference is that it takes more time and paperwork, but the legal authority is still there.\n\n\n\nThere is no legal limit on how high the tariffs can go under Section 301. Trump can impose 100 percent, 500 percent, or higher tariffs if he wants. The courts are not likely to stop this, and the only way to limit it is for Congress to change the law.\n\n\n\nI asked AI to argue against this theory and it wasnt able to give me a good objection. If this is incorrect, please tell me why.\n\n\n\nTldr: The IEEPA ruling does not prevent Trump from doing the same thing through the Trade Act of 1974",

There are still a handful of things I haven't found good replacements for, but I've replaced most of my regular grocery items with things made by Canada or our friends abroad (the hash browns I get now amusingly are from Belgium apparently? Nice country, visited once many years ago).\n\nIf the tariffs and annexation talk stops tomorrow, I will still be calling my MP to encourage them to continue efforts to diversify our trade. I want our relationship with the US to be permanently lessened.\n\nThe US is no longer perceived as a reliable trade partner by the majority of the world.

The market cap was absurd (and is still probably too high) so really we just returned to normal. So stock holders need to decide where they think it will go from here.\n\nTesla no longer holds the dominant market share for EV's that it held just a few years ago. You can buy electric cars from virtually any manufacturer. To make matters worse, if you made a Venn diagram of electric car customers and their political leanings, I'm sure you'd find that left-leaning voters are far more likely to purchase a Tesla. This means that Musk's political activity has alienated more purchasers than non-purchasers, both in the US and abroad.\n\nMy gut tells me to avoid Tesla stock because it's simply too volatile. I could be wrong. It may have bottomed out and is an excellent growth opportunity. I think it's more likely that Tesla's sales are distributed among other manufacturers, old (Toyota) and new (Lucid).",

In retaliation, China raised tariffs on American goods to 125%. Despite US efforts to arrange a call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing has refused, with Xi emphasizing China’s self-reliance and readiness for a prolonged trade conflict. The White House insists China must make the first move, while Trump believes Beijing will eventually seek a deal to address issues like US exports, fentanyl, and TikTok. The escalating trade war between the two superpowers shows no signs of easing as both sides wait for the other to yield.",

They probably still are. The sympathy of those of us who saw the tsunami coming and ran around the beach trying to warn people will be of little comfort to the folks who are about to be completely blindsided by reality. It's easy to be angry with them for being too apathetic or distracted to see what was happening right in front of them, and to take action while there was still time to do something. But there's another group of people who did see the tsunami coming and ran around the beach assuring the distracted that the big wave was just a liberal conspiracy. To believe what they were being told above what they may have thought they saw with their own eyes. \n\nIf you saw the tsunami coming and didn't stand to directly profit from its arrival on-shore, you probably cashed out some or all of your stock in January. If you shoved your head into the sand in an effort to ignore the people screaming at you about the tsunami, and your life savings gets washed away--it's hard to have sympathy for that. But at the end of the day, there are those of us who are going to suffer, and there are the people who set us up for this. Who led the lambs to slaughter and assured them that there was no tsunami headed their way. Those are the people we need to hold accountable. They knew. They planned it all. That's no conspiracy--go read the plans they made widely available before election day and compare notes with the current headlines. It's all written out in black and white.",
