        "description": "My partner travels 100 % and is gone for months at a time. He only rarely comes home for a weekend or a week once in a blue moon.  Since it’s Labor Day weekend he has a few days off and decided to come home.  He was trying to set something up with our tv and said that things would be easier if I didn’t have “all this garbage”. \n\nI’m pretty upset and this is the only room in the house that gets any light since his mom had to move in with us and I lost my nursery/ office space.  Personally I love my plants and this space makes me so happy and I feel like I’ve come a long way with my plant care.  Stupid question but does it look like garbage?  I have cats so my options for putting them anywhere else with grow  lights is pretty nonexistent. ",

If he wants certain areas cleared or the plants displayed in a certain way, he should communicate that versus saying it’d be easier “without all this garbage.” \n\nMaybe have a discussion about how those words made you feel and understand what specifically about the plants upsets him / communicate your needs and figure out his?",

Thought about it and this is what I want to say, our connection to nature is one of the most important connections we have and share with others. Many cultures around the world recognize the mental health qualities that come from tending to nature and connecting with nature.\nFor most of us, the easiest form of connecting to nature is growing our own plants. It as basic as growing our own food. A person who cannot connect with this basic need, has shut themselves off from a lot of qualities in life. \nYour love of growing plants soothes your connection to nature, calms you, cleans your air, and brings peace to your home. In many ways, it’s probably the best way you’ve been able to connect with yourself and stay grounded while you watch over his mother. \nThis person isn’t the right person for you. He’s not on the same wavelength as you he isn’t seeing , your higher self.",

Then one day I saw this beautiful aquarium on my phone, so I tried.\nFirst time, I got a 3g acrilyc aquarium with a built in filter and light. I went to the pet shop and got 2 plants, anubias nana petite and some java fern. \nAfter doing more research, I realized that my built in light wasn't gonna work to grow plants. \nSo I went on FB marketplace, I found a 6.6g glass rimless aquarium and a Led light for planted aquariums. The tank also came with a separate filter and filter medias. It was the first time I saw growth on an aquatic plant, and I was in love. \n",

                "comment": "From AI: Hurricanes can sometimes stimulate flowering in certain plants, but it largely depends on the species and local conditions. The strong winds, rainfall, and changes in atmospheric pressure associated with a nearby hurricane can act as stressors. Some plants respond to stress by entering reproductive modes, which can trigger flowering. Additionally, the increased rain and temporary cooling effect might support flowering in plants that are sensitive to environmental changes.\n\nHowever, for some plants, excessive wind and rain can damage foliage, hinder growth, or even cause a delay in flowering. The outcome would depend on how resilient the plant species is to these factors.",
