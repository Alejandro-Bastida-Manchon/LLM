Zelenskyy is too petty to swallow his pride and do what's best for the greater good.\n\nThis would MAYBE check out if it wasn't for Trump and Vance putting their own petty, fragile little egoes above absolutely everything else. \n\nThe most important thing is that the world's leaders come crawling on their hands and knees (wearing suits goddammit) up to the iron throne and grovel real good before the orange king. \n\nWe've all treated the USA horribly and abused them for years. Now we should have the decency to apologise and thank Trump and Vance profusely for everything they've had zero part in giving, before they pull the rug on us.\n\nI guess if you genuinely think America and Americans are above everyone else, you see nothing wrong with this?",

                "comment": "Ironically the ones that look the most fitting are Netanyahu and Putin. This is no reflection on either individual, especially the former, merely on their respective aesthetic proximity to 1940s self-presentation. Though Putin (note, the only one of six in Schutzstaffel rather than Wehrmacht garb… rather fitting imho) has that added, Reinhard Heydrich like ice cold stare. Totally in character.\n\nMusk reminds me of the portrayal of Luftwaffe officers in 1970s war movies, or perhaps the role interpretation of Albert Speer in the same era, successful in upholding the image of the sophisticated gentleman Nazi curated at Nuremberg. That particular image conveys a zeitgeist about three decades more recent than the ‘original’. Just as those movies.\n\nOf course, Trump and Farage are way off—no Wehrmacht officers would have grimaced or smirked when having their photos taken. Farage’s noticeably lower rank is a nice touch, though. Vance’s head shape looks off: Men in the 1940s had leaner faces; even Göring. Of course, a full beard—even trimmed—and wearing eye liner was totally against Wehrmacht regulations, LMAO!\n\nWhat’s so telling about this image is that with the exception of Putin, the aesthetics of right-wing authoritarianism seem to have taken a full 180-degree turn from their mid-20th century bespoke-tailored role models, all surface discipline and such.\n\nThat about-face goes for Führers and followers alike, I might add.",

By that logic, Ukraine is just being extremely unfriendly to Putin right now.\n\nI would not be surprised if he felt that is an unfriendly act that we do not send our eggs to him after he halted trade himself.",

It’s not my first time and I’ve had this long-term plan for a while, but part of my impetus this time was definitely the political current in the US. I’ve spent the last 10 years living in Wisconsin, a state which is shackled by the same kind of politicians now running the White House, so I knew what was coming. My final straw was when the WI legislature illegally blocked university employees from receiving a mandated annual inflationary raise all state employees receive over the university’s (attempts at) diversity and inclusion policies. Everyone from janitors to the highest-chaired tenured professors were impacted. I won’t stick around to be spit on like that. I made a plan, got hired, and now I have a stable job, a pension, and am a union member in Norway. Of course no place is perfect, but I am very happy to be here and grateful to my workplace for wanting to sponsor me. Thinking of all my fellow American academics and others at American institutions - your work is important, and they can’t silence us.",

Far-right movements are gaining momentum, mainstream parties are normalizing extremist rhetoric, and there's a general unwillingness to address the structural vulnerabilities that allow authoritarian ideologies to spread.\n\nNo amount of military power can protect us from the insidious influence of online propaganda. The U.S. possesses the most powerful military in history, yet it was effectively undermined by Putin’s information warfare. No tanks or missiles were needed, just a strategic campaign of misinformation, manipulation, and social division, which ultimately helped install a puppet leader who serves foreign interests. This happened not through brute force but through the exploitation of a populace unprepared to navigate a landscape of deception.\n\nThe fundamental weakness of modern democracies isn't a lack of firepower; it’s a lack of media literacy and informal logic. Without these skills, even the most advanced nations can be conquered, not by armies, but by narratives. The battlefield of the 21st century isn’t just physical; it’s digital, ideological, and psychological.\n\nThis is why education must adapt. Media literacy and informal logic should no longer be treated as secondary subjects. They must become a top priority in schools. In an era where disinformation spreads faster than the truth, every citizen must possess the ability to critically analyze information, recognize logical fallacies, and differentiate between reality and manipulation. Without this foundation, a democracy is too vulnerable.",

A lot of useful and helpful programs to the low-income are being cut mostly because DOGE doesn't see it making money. Medical has always been a problem that caused great financial burden. Our current administration discrimates against immigrants, transgendered, and anybody who isn't white white. The police aren't your friend and many of them would violate your rights without check.\n\nWe were viewed as a great nation. Now it's pretty embarrassing when I have to tell foreigners that I'm American. I feel like we're stepping back into 1984 (book). We even managed to make our good neighbors (Canada) dislike us. Also, our current administration doesn't understand how tariffs work. They screwed over us. Not him so they think it's okay. \n\nI remember they said when they got in office they would reduce the price of eggs. They're ridiculously priced. Now the president is saying \"shut up about egg prices.\".\n\nAnyways, I'm rambling on. Does anybody want to offer me citizenship to another country?",

I didn't vote for the Mango Mussolini, and I am ashamed and horrified at that he's doing, and it's described perfectly as betrayal.

With a conclave of billionaire bastards like Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and others, all subscribing to Curtis Yarvin's rhetoric, they want to crush every government and rule everything in their own little kingdoms. \n\nIf you want to stop Trump, Europe and whats left of the free world need to go after his backers, like Musk, Thiel, Yarvin, and the other billionaires.",

My grandfather came from Ukraine and fought in WWII against the Nazis, met my grandmother in England and built a life here in America. \n\nSeeing what transpired today is the lowest I’ve felt as an American. \n\nWithout repeating all that’s been said about trump and Vance, I want to say President Zelenskyy is a true leader. A man with virtue and humility. I’d fight for him before I ever shook trumps hand. \n\nAmerica is currently FUBAR. \n\nYou guys must unite and pick up the mantle of decency and liberty. We will hopefully get back to an America that was revered at one time, but you can’t wait for that. \n\nIt sickens me that America of old would have threatened the actual enemy (Russia) and fought alongside Ukraine for their freedom, and for the simple fact that it was the right thing to do. \n\nToday, us US citizens witnessed the turning point in our history that we are lead by a bitch. A bitch who is pandering to Putin and selling out the little guy while trying to extort natural resources. \n\nI am not ok with this. Many other Americans are not ok with this. But we are so paralyzed internally at the moment that nothing internationally can really be in the benefit of our allies. Most of us don’t want this. \n\nI love our Canadian brothers in the north. I love the English and Germans and the French and the Ukrainians and all the other places of freedom and hope and decency. \n\nIt just seems that our fucked up leaders don’t care. They are ruled by self interest and greed. Hellbent on bringing this once great constitutional republic to its knees. \n\nI wish I could end more positively. But this is the realism we face and until we get our own country straightened out, we can’t be trusted at the helm of trump.",

Given the C.I.A's track record of covert coup d'etats, it didn't seem unlikely to me that Zelensky was also a puppet, installed by the US to represent their interests. \nA deep hatred for american foreign policy shaped my bias so that I would be more receptive for any anti-american explanation of this war. Being on X certainly didn't help either.\n\nI've come around since then, and President Zelenskyy has nothing but my respect. And despite disgraceful attacks by Trump and his cohort, he will be remembered by us europeans as a valiant defender of his country and who was right all along about the danger that is Putin.",

By now, they we have “maxed out” on the richer people and the cost is still high, so for those with lower wages still cannot afford it. The high prices are mostly due to the EU not having enough resources to produce these cars. \nRare minerals largely come from China and smaller, warring countries… So there is also an ideological debate, not just an economic problem…\n\nAll in all, the EU is in a very bad position when it comes to electric cars, and due to the decline in sales, our leaders really need to come up with solutions for green transition to continue.",

My wife and I are planning our exit (hard to do after establishing lives here for as long as we have).\n\nAs much as I’m pessimistic about the next little while in the world with all the tumult we are facing, I have no doubt that Canada/Europe/Australia/NZ/etc will be able to get through this and emerge stronger than ever.\n\nTogether, everyone achieves more.  Knowing that Europe/Canada/etc are there for each other makes me confident that we’ll all get through this shit the US and its new allies are trying to do.\n\nThere is nobody I’d rather have on my side than Europe. Most Canadians agree with me.\n\nThank you all for having our backs.  It won’t ever be forgotten.",

Current estimates put a number at around 800,000 people (out of 6.6 million). \n\nFew days ago, the ruling party attempted to fool the public by installing their own fake 40 year old students (ćaci) in the park in front of the Parliament building, in a pathetic attempt to show that they still have support. These people are paid to be there, of course from our money. Many of them have been recognised by their neighbours as low level bureaucrats in their municipalities, always part of the ruling SNS party.\n\nThe government tried to stop people from coming by obstructing the railway transport with a convenient false bomb threat. They also stopped all intercity public transport, including even the buses from privately owned firms by threatening them.\n\nThis morning, the day of the protest, as expected, they stopped all of Belgrade's public transport, leaving many people without a way to even get to work.\n\nIn spite of all this, the people have gathered in numbers surpassing every other protest in Serbia by a large margin. Current estimates are placing the number at more than 800,000 people, and the mass is still gathering. The whole city is at a complete standstill, crowds are everywhere. For comparison, the protest of 2000 when Slobodan Milošević was overthrown counted roughly 100,000 people. The total population of Belgrade is around 1.5 million.\n\nWe're fighting for justice, nothing more, nothing less. 13 years of corruption and poor management which culminated in the deaths of 15 innocent people just waiting for their train brought us to this historical moment. The will of the people will prevail! This can no longer be stopped!\n\nThanks for all your support, Europe!",

The world used to respect America.. not just for its military strength, but for its leadership, diplomacy, and ability to bring nations together. And Now? Thanks to his arrogant, brain-dead remarks and nonstop insults, the U.S. isn’t admired. It’s tolerated at best and despised at worst.\n\nBefore this disaster of an administration, if a U.S. Vice President visited Greenland, they’d be met with warmth and open arms. \n\nNow, after this neo-imperialist posturing, bullying, and “America First” nonsense, people see the U.S. for what it’s becoming… an insecure empire.\n\nAmerica’s greatness wasn’t built on brute force alone..\n\nit was built on alliances, trust, and the idea that it stood for something bigger than just itself. And now, we’re watching this buffoon rip all of that to shreds in real time, mistaking belligerence for strength while the rest of the world rolls its eyes and moves on.",
