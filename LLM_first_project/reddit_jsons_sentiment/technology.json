And I guarantee fans of these reedits will claim their subreddit doesn't do this. IT DOES. As an active fan of r/yangforpresidenthq the amount of circle jerking is insane. They are small so the misleading isn't rampant like r/politics, but one day if it grows it will get there. \n\nSadly Reddit is extremely Democratic and it artificially creates more democratic circle jerking and bias. And redditors act like it is because dems are always right. Reality is the country is nearly split in 1/2 and reddit is more like 10/90 which is very unhealthy. Honestly there needs to be some way to moderate in more conservative takes and in a fair way. Because they do have a point many times. Hell I got banned from r/ourpresident for disagreeing a wealth tax(which there are legit concerns that people are not allowed to discuss on reddit in fear of bans). Legit I didn't even say bad words or anything hating Bernie who ironically is not our president. They just refuse outside info. \n\nTo be clear as I said I am an Andrew Yang fan, I am by no means republican. My favorite presidents vary from dem to republican. And personally I identify as Independent. Personally I view picking sides as pure stupidity. No offense to you who do. (I say all this before the comment hating me for being a rep, even though I'm not)\n\nTo further my point I just got banned on r/politics for this exact comment copy pasted below. Apparently it is hate speech you read yourself. It was on banning the electoral college. I did 0 editing here and on comment and also had an upvote, 1, but still someone agreed with me I was not negative just mods disagree with me and want to circle jerk. yes Environments is spelled wrong, like I said no editing. \n\n \"I actually disagree with this. The electoral college is the only way the smaller farmer or rural districts can get any representation in the executive branch. Which would mean democrats will basically always control the executive branch. To me this is a big step in a way to reduce fairness in elections. Even the founding fathers knew this and put the electoral college in place to protect against this, and also to outweigh the poor, which is sad, but it does genuinely protect those in rural enviorments.\"",

                "comment": "There's actually a way to force the Senate to vote on saving net neutrality. It's called the Congressional Review Act. Under this law, Congress can block any agency decision by passing a resolution of disapproval in both chambers. This resolution cannot be filibustered in the Senate and only 30 senators need to sign a petition to force a vote.\n\nEd Markey has already said he'll introduce a CRA resolution: https://twitter.com/ACLU_Mass/status/940251501695590405\n\nSusan Collins supports net neutrality. If Doug Jones wins tomorrow, that would mean only one other Republican senator would need to flip for the bill to pass the Senate. So... if you live in Alabama and care about net neutrality, you should definitely vote.  \n\nEdit: To clarify though, Trump could still veto the resolution and it would also have to pass the House. But this is a way to force every senator to take a position on this issue before next year's midterm elections. And who knows what will happen if it builds enough momentum. Elected politicians are a lot more responsive to public opinion than FCC commissioners are.  \n\nThe CRA was actually passed by Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in the 1990s to make it easier to kill regulations. But it applies as much to an agency decision to repeal a regulation as it does to enact one. It sure would be deliciously ironic to use the CRA to save net neutrality. If you're curious about the CRA, you can read more here: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43992.pdf",

Comcast....have earned so many peoples respect and compassion. They truly are corporations for the people. I can't wait for them to do nothing but good for the Internet as they see it. They will surely not take advantage of dissolved regulations. It's all about innovation, and the man has been keeping those poor little ISPs down. \n\nLobbying ISPs are of no concern either, they are just paying our spent money back to government servants to persuade them into freeing the internet, so those freedom fighter ISPs can make it better for us. They only have the betterment of us in mind, surely.\n\nIn all seriousness, our government has been taken. And by who? Corporations like Comcast. Let's just skip a step and put the power directly in their hands. Soon we will vote for brands instead of people to lead. \n\nMaybe we should start stripping other regulations as well? Like if someone cuts someone else off in traffic, or just does something to irritate another driver, said driver should be able to run the aforementioned off the road, hopefully killing them. Thus improving traffic, as there will be less drivers. That's Innovation!....right?! Am I doing this right?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The republican congress operates under the fucking [hastert rule which says this wont fucking see the light of day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule) The fucking hastert rule say no fucking thing makes it to teh floor for a vote, without a majority of republican support. Dems dont do the hastert bullshit.\n\nOK now read my second point, while thinking on he first point.\n\nYou can waste your time. But like i said before, its like drowning people, reaching to grab out for something solid that just is not there. You want to stop this? vote in 2018 and 2020.\n\nYou can spread this to china.. it wont fucking get a vote. its a bill by a dem that a super majority of republicans disagree with.\n\nAnd here is the rub, congressional GOP know they wont get in trouble for not doing anything. Fuck they know as long as they are running against a dem their base will vote for them. So we are fucked. ",

Definitely an exec, but imagine having the gall to call yourself an artist in that position.\n\n\nRegarding Biden, what this tells us is that he'd rather be stubborn and closed-minded rather than do the research and make a conclusion on his own. Not a big surprise coming from a career politician.",

                "comment": "> NYT: Under the Obama administration, Silicon Valley’s power actually expanded greatly. There are very few mergers blocked. Do you have any regrets about that?\n\n> JB: [...] And you may recall, the criticism I got for meeting with the leaders in Silicon Valley, when I was trying to work out an agreement dealing with them protecting intellectual property for artists in the United States of America. And at one point, one of the little creeps sitting around that table, who was a multi- — close to a billionaire — who told me he was an artist because he was able to come up with games to teach you how to kill people, you know the ——\n\n> NYT: Like video games.\n\n> JB: Yeah, video games. And I was lectured by one of the senior leaders there that by saying if I insisted on what Leahy’d put together and we were, I thought we were going to fully support, that they would blow up the network, figuratively speaking. Have everybody contact. They get out and go out and contact the switchboard, just blow it up. \n\nBiden was apparently retelling a story of some meeting with tech giants regarding legislation for protecting the IP of artists put together by Seantor Leahy ... which on some digging appears to me to be [PIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act) (remember the whole \"stop SOPA/PIPA\" thing everyone was on about some years back?) ... and one of the people at that meeting that opposed Leahy's legislation that claimed to protect the IP of artists from online piracy was a video game developer, and Biden (as an aside) apparently objects to the notion that video game developers are also \"artists\". Biden is most definitely at least putting words in the developers mouth during the retelling of the story, and the guy probably just said something along the lines that he was an artist too.\n\nIn fairness, the \"little creep\" remark seems to be more focused on the apparent threat made by the game developer of using their lobbying power to rally up the internet to stop SOPA/PIPA (on the backdrop of the greater context of the asked question of whether or not the tech industry has accumulated too much power), with the idea of belittling game developers as not being artists to begin with as a garnish to that statement.\n\nPersonally speaking, I never really invested the time to understand the details for myself on exactly why everyone on the internet was trying to stop SOPA/PIPA, but it was my impression that the argument against SOPA/PIPA was that the newly proposed rules to stop piracy would fundamentally damage first amendment protections on the internet as collateral damage ... and that it was my impression that it was a good thing for the \"little creeps\" of the tech industry to \"blow up the switchboard\" and take point on a massive lobbying campaign against SOPA/PIPA (who knows if my impression is actually true because I never read the legislation, but Biden appears to be on the wrong side of history here).\n\nOverall, not a good look for Biden among millennial voters in the upcoming primaries, but in disclosing bias, I personally wasn't going to vote for him anyway in the primaries, he's always been too much of a corporate center-right democrat that was way too cozy with the credit card companies for my tastes.\n\n- So the TLDR story appears to be: Biden in response to a question about the growing power of the tech industry calls those in the tech industry \"little creeps\" for threatening to leverage their power to oppose SOPA/PIPA (controversial anti-piracy legislation for the protection of \"artists\") while deriding a video game makers claim of being an artist.\n\nEdit: Obligatory thanks for the shinies (but go support your candidate of choice), and here's the source for the [NYT Biden interview](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html) that I was quoting and meant to post.\n\nAlso wanted to respond to a question posed in this now locked thread: \n\n> But would you vote for him come November, if he turns out to be the candidate?\n\nBiden is admittedly not my first, second, or even third choice in the primary (everyone is free to their own leanings in this regard, and I won't belabor mine) ... but staying home for the general if Biden is nominated, or throwing away that vote on a third party candidate in our winner-take-all system (as the vote suppressing trolls out there would want us to do), that would be the equivalent of cutting off the nose to spite the face, and I do not believe in doing that. It's a two party system, and people need to vote accordingly until that system is changed.\n\nPrimaries are important, they shape the parties themselves. Everyone please vote, and vote often.",

It is interesting history to me that the anon ‘leaders’ were long ago arrested by FBI and disbanded. Any action they take now is in support of our government. The current cabinet that according to polls over 65% of Americans distrust. \n\nJust think about the timing of stuff people, what are they trying to hide by putting so much attention on WAR.",

Governments (ESPECIALLY THE US) have some of the best security/tech people working for them in the world. and getting thru to say cancel debts or “mess with banks” is pretty much impossible unless you can somehow create something that can get past the systems in place AND be untraceable. The people who do try, you would not hear about in the news. \n\nAnd even if someone did create that, the risk of getting caught would mean the end of your freedom or perhaps even your life. \n\nLet’s use basketball as an example. Someone exists out there that is amazing at the sport that isn’t in the NBA. They have practiced everyday and are a literal gift to the sport, but they do not play in the NBA. That same person is smart enough to know that they could not beat the entirety of the Lakers by themselves. MAYBE they could but the chances are slim and the risk of being just absolutely dumpstered (arrested) for a single, tiny mistake is too high. Plus, if you have that much knowledge and ability to play, why not use it to make money? Why throw it away to be absolutely smashed by a professional team?\n\nSomeone with the ability to do such a high caliber disruption online isn’t some basement dweller like the media portrays, it’s a highly educated individual who has spent their life learning and coding and is most likely very successful in a different field all together.",

In California they have the CCPA which raises that age to 18. Unless Biden considers “children” over the age of 13 I don’t know what else he wants to do. Like others have mentioned, there is a difference between targeting a specific person, and ppl in general. The difference is if knew an online user was under 13 and served them ad while they were checking the weather (example site) BECAUSE they were under 13, that’s already illegal. However, I could run ads on Cartoon Network knowing that a large portion of the viewers are under 13, but I’m not specifically targeting any individual under 13.",

It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case \"[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)\" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)\n\n[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.\n\nCompanies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just \"behave\" when they have abused their power time and time again.\n\nFight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.\n",

They see a domain they don't like and use the scare tactic of threatening letters with lots of words like \"infringement\" and \"illegal\" thrown in to make you cave.  That doesn't mean you have broken the law, though.\n\nHowever, your case is unique because of the content of the page and what the domain is.  If your domain was comcastsucks.com, it would be perfectly legal because people know that it's going to be critical of Comcast before they actually get to the site.  But with comcastroturf.com, normal people don't know what's on the site *before* they visit.  Comcastroturf could easily be a website for a Community Astroturf company (and I know that's a stretch, but think of what less tech-savvy, older people would think).  \n\nThe other half is the content, in which you are critical of Comcast by name, but only in your conclusion.  This could leave the average viewer a bit confused at to why comcast is in the domain name, since there isn't anything critical as soon as the webpage opens.\n\nSo, in their eyes, you're not being *directly* critical of Comcast in the domain or content, which they see as infringing.  In my opinion, I think this could be fair use, but it'd be a close call, and that would depend heavily on the judge that you got.  The big issue is the disconnect between the domain name and the content.  You could change the content, but at this point, I can guarantee you that they already spidered your site and have screen shots of what your page looks like when it loads.\n\nEdit: As a follow up, lawyer up and have them send a letter claiming free speech, fair use, nonconfusing, etc.  They'll know what to do and how to do it.  Also, so long as you're not trying to profit from the site, either by selling it, raising funds through it, or promoting anything for which you get compensation (including advertising, or bartering for use of the domain), you'll be in a great position to fend this off.",

                "comment": "Hey there! I'm a former analyst for LookingGlass, I can shed some light on this! And you'll probably want to read this; it's even worse for Comcast and LG than you think.\n\nComcast contracts with LookingGlass to detect and remove threats to its brand and trademark online. Normally this is done for the right reasons, either sending takedown requests to obvious cyber-squatting domains similar to the actual trademark in an attempt to trick people, or phishing scams. But, this was clearly not the case here!\n\nHere's what happened: LG's automated crawler looks for recently-registered domain names with client trademarks in them. This crawler then sends an email to the client informing them of the domains and asking if they would like us to take action on them. Here's the key part: LG didn't just automatically submit a takedown request for this domain. Comcast was notified of this domain name, and asked that LG take it down. Uh-oh.\n\nMost likely, takedown was approved for this domain before any content was actually uploaded to the site. But that doesn't really make a difference; this is still fair use. But it does explain that this is likely due to incompetence and ignorance of the law rather than outright malevolence. We were frequently asked to do takedown on charity sites that mentioned they had been sponsored by our clients (which they had been) just because they used Comcast's logo on the charity site. A logo placement that Comcast **paid to have on the charity's site**. Sometimes we were asked to do takedown on third-party affiliates that were corporate partners with our clients, effectively they asked us to shoot down their own site! The incompetence on parade here never failed to astound me.\n\nHowever! Comcast frequently used LG as its personal corporate bullying service, so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if this was done with malicious intent instead of plain old dumbfuckery. I was asked to do takedown on Youtube videos because they ranked higher than Comcast's own videos in the search results, for example. So I wouldn't rule out mustache-twirling villainy. \n\nBut the best part? In the rare instances in which an analyst would dispute a takedown request by informing the management that the content in question fell under the umbrella of fair use, they would be told to proceed anyway. It didn't matter in the slightest how shitty Comcast's case for takedown was, the client's wishes always took precedent. I personally advocated tenaciously against several takedowns of content similar to this domain, using the logic that attempting to take down the domain name would lead to a massive blowback against Comcast and LG if the person who received the notice posted it online. I linked the wikipedia page for the Streisand Effect to management, even. Didn't matter in the end most of the time, but we got lucky and never had any serious fallout. Until now! \n\nThese notices don't do anything anyway, something I tried and failed to explain. They aren't legally binding, they aren't real cease and desist orders, they're basically nothing but a threat. But they don't even result in domains getting taken down because there's already a process for disputing a trademark in a domain name, it's called a UDRP dispute. This isn't a UDRP, and registrars and site owners know that, and they all tell LG (and rightly so) \"UDRP or GTFO\". But that requires a legal team to draft, and that's expensive, so let's just lie to our clients and pretend that these \"takedowns\" actually do something. \"Best-effort\", right? \n\nAnd the REALLY tragic thing? The analyst who submitted this is almost certainly getting thrown to the wolves, just for following orders. I watched it happen several times, an analyst would be crucified for doing exactly what management told them to do! Most of the analysts there wouldn't even be able to define fair use, much less catch something like this. You can't expect a SOC workforce that is almost exclusively part-timers making $18/hr (in the DC area, lel) to know these kinds of things, you have to have faith that the client knows the law and knows how things are likely to shake out. I hope it's clear now more than ever that any faith in Comcast to even approach doing the right thing is completely misplaced, which comes as a surprise to fucking nobody except for the management at LookingGlass.\n\nTo add insult to injury, LookingGlass is largely concerned with anti-phishing efforts, which is actually useful work that protects people from being defrauded and having their bank accounts emptied. That's one of the rare instances in which doing something to protect people and a company's brand are the same thing. But just to give you a dipstick as to the level of competence LookingGlass can bring to the table, LookingGlass, an anti-phishing company, was itself phished earlier this year. Someone sent a phishing email to LG asking for W-2s of every current and past employee, which were helpfully zipped up and sent off to the attacker. This resulted in several of my co-workers having their tax returns claimed by someone else before they filed, effectively stealing their tax return via identity theft as a result of this phishing scam. *LG only bothered to inform the employees that this was happening about two months after they were phished.* I received a letter in the mail after I had quit that informed me of what'd happened, and took the opportunity to up-sell me on purchasing coverage from Identity Guard Gold^tm as a helpful and easy payroll deduction! What a bargain! Thanks for giving away all of the information that someone would need to steal my identity LG, I'm really stoked to be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my fucking life! ",

They treated me like Brendan Dassey, they just kept asking \"Ok do you have friends or family that will want this account?\" or \"Give us the names of the people moving into your service address\".\n\nA month later I was still being charged, they didn't put in the cancel request, I had to call two more times at which time they said they would have to *schedule* a deactivation...\n\nWait what? I didn't have cable tv and I was providing my own cable modem for internet, there was literally nothing for them to cancel other than deactivating their shitty inbound on that address. \n\nYears later I had AT&T and the dreaded day came to cancel. Friendliest guy in the world answered the call. I said I was moving, he said when, I gave the date. He said no problem, you're good to go, no questions.\n\nThat's it? What about your combo modem I was leasing?\n\nNope, he laughed and said \"*you paid for it, should make a nice doorstop if nothing else*.\n\nI was nearly in shock.

And I thought Title 2 was good for net neutrality, but a lot of the comments are some variant of this:\n\n\"To the FCC: With respect to the FCC's Open Internet order. I strongly ask the FCC to reverse Tom Wheeler's decision to control the Internet. Internet users, as opposed to the FCC Enforcement Bureau, ought to select which applications we desire. Tom Wheeler's decision to control the Internet is a betrayal of net neutrality. It undid a market-based system that worked very, very well for two decades with broad bipartisan backing.\"\n\nIs this message one of the anti-net neutrality messages, then? \n\nThis is where I'm reading it explained that carriers aren't even really upheld to Title 2 reclassification?? But if that were true, then idk why carriers would be seemingly causing such a stink about this Title 2 reclassification. \n\nUhgh this is exhausting to look at. But I did come across many copy + paste anti-NN submissions by searching a single name. But, idk, my pro-net neutrality submission I made was from a copy/paste; however, I can't seem to find my submission now?? I swore it was on the FCC website...\n",

We are going to take on the greedy internet, telecom, and cable monopolies and put an end to their absurd price gouging. Just as President Roosevelt fundamentally made America more equal by bringing electricity to every farm and rural community over 80 years ago, as president, I will do the same with high-speed internet.”\n\nHaving high-speed internet is central to the basic functions of families, students, and businesses, yet across the country huge swaths of the population lack access to an internet connection or cannot afford the options available. \n\nAs president, Bernie will stop the practice of treating high-speed internet access like a luxury item, and instead treat it like a public utility that everyone deserves as a basic human right. Bernie will also take on the greed of the telecom and cable monopolies who exploit their dominant market power to rip off consumers and lobby government at all levels to keep out competition. Ending this type of greed and corruption will be a major priority under a Sanders administration.\n\n**Bernie’s plan would:**\n\n* Provide $150 billion through the Green New Deal in infrastructure grants and technical assistance for municipalities and/or states to build publicly owned and democratically controlled, co-operative, or open access broadband networks.\n* Require that all internet service providers offer a Basic Internet Plan that provides quality broadband speeds at an affordable price.\n* Break up internet service provider and cable monopolies, bar service providers from providing content, and unwind anticompetitive mergers.\n* Increase the FCC definition of minimum broadband speeds to 100mbps for downloads and 10mbps for uploads.\n* Set aside $7.5 billion to expand high-speed broadband in Indian Country and fully resource the FCC’s Office of Native Affairs and Policy.\n* Ensure people with disabilities have full access to the internet.\n* Guarantee all public housing residents free broadband services.\n* Ensure broadband infrastructure is resilient to the effects of climate change.\n\n[**Help us RT on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1202971373234262017)\n\n[**Read the full plan here**](https://berniesanders.com/issues/high-speed-internet-all/)",

In addition, we gather much of our traffic data from direct sources in the form of sites that have chosen to install the Alexa script on their site and certify their metrics.

The easy part of facilitating tens of thousands of GME buy orders from retail investors is the part they accomplished. Shiny webpage, nice interface, immediate confirmations to users. The hard part is turning around and working with clearing houses to actually source that much of a single security, particularly when this means that you as a counterparty are now massively long in a stock which may experience a significant decline in value. I don't think many in the industry were surprised to see the clearing brokers demand more margin (they did the exact same thing during last March).",

If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.\nLast week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. \nWe had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds. \n\n(Emphasis theirs)\n\nI love that they're trying to hide behind regulations and insist that while they did take action to help hedge funds they didnt want to and that should count for something. Also no explanation so far for the artificial restrictions on dogecoin, where hedge fund managers fear to tread.",

But that won't match reality at all.  Most of the coin will not have changed hands at the 71USD value.\n\nWhich isn't to say that people didn't lose money, just that the specific figure is based on bullshit accounting.",

The value and \"market cap\" of a cryptocurrency can go up over time to represent a value massively larger than the sum total of investments.\n\nAs an example, if a PUMPNDUMP coin launches, and someone buys 1,000 of them for $1.  That represents $1,000 input capital, and the coin has a market cap of $1,000.  If another person buys 3 more, for $100 each, they are inputting only $300 capital, yet the market cap of the coin is now up to  $100,300.\n\nIf the value of the coin then goes to $0, sensationalist articles like this will claim that over $100,300 was lost by supporters, as that's the decline in market cap.

No freaking way.\n\nAnd then on the other hand if a lot of people have a similar reaction to me then how good are these subreddits going to be? I mean I'm not going to camp them answering questions myself. Maybe other people won't either. Or maybe only people like content creators who are trying to market their YouTube channel or whatever, Instagram, whatever pays their bills. Maybe they'll use it.\n\nBut I'm basically pretty much done with this website if I can't use RIF or something as good.\n\nHave you ever tried commenting and having a conversation on YouTube? No wonder the comments section there sucks: it's an enormous pain in the ass. I mean I'm not going to run down the features but it's not worth my time. Sometimes I'll say one thing to try to get engagement numbers up for a YouTuber I like; I consider that a little bit like leaving a small tip.

He also had a comic called Life on Forbez, that really pushed his drawing skills in the later issues. gamerulers.com was basically just this coder chicks fan site that had many cool people who helped form a lot of the opinions I have now, and I posted a lot of cringe shit, but I was a kid enamored by a bunch of people in this community who loved the same stuff I did.

If that app goes away, I won't be adopting the official app. For one, the official app is terrible, you can't even customize your views, you're forced into their feeds where they present you posts and ads that are not relevant. It's an anti-user experience. No, if RIF goes away, I will be done with Reddit. Tired of these anti-user policies, you aren't going to get what you want out of this, you aren't going to usher in some new era of user driven content. Your user base will slowly shrink and eventually you'll be left with the bots and auto mods that run the place. All you have managed to do with this, is piss off a large portion of your user base, without which, this site would be nothing.",

Luckily, I found a firmware installation tool that was able to flash the old firmware onto my Epson XP-440 Series printer so I could continue using my knock-off refilled generic cheap set of cartridges that cost 13 times less than the OEM brand.\n\nFuck you Epson for doing such a shitty thing to your loyal customers!  You've permanently lost me as a lifetime customer.  I will never ever buy another Epson brand product for the rest of my life.  I will tell everyone who cares to ask about this shitty experience I had with your Epson product so hopefully they will also avoid purchasing Epson products in the future.  I've left an amazon negative review already on that product page so I hope a lot of potential customers walk away from buying that product.  Epson, I hope you lose enough market share that you go out of business eventually.  These are unacceptable business practices.",

The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.\nHowever there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!\nIt sounds great but;\n1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!\n2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.\n3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.\n\nNet neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.\n \nSo yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers. So beware and make sure every not-tech-savvy person is informed on the risk!",

Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless. For many years, Chairman Pai has called on the FCC to update its media ownership regulations—one of which dates back to 1975. The Chairman is sticking to his long-held views, and given the strong case for modernizing these rules, it's not surprising that those who disagree with him would prefer to do whatever they can to distract from the merits of his proposals.",
