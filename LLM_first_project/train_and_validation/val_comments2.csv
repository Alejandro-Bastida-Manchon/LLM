"This announcement does not make me feel hopeful for the adult user experience (though I do think it conveys a responsibility that was lacking before regarding having a separate experience for underage people in the first place). However it implies cracking down harder on user inputs that do not meet “community guidelines.” So it’s no longer just about whether or not the bots adhere to the guidelines that they have set forth (regardless of whether or not it is a true reflection of the community/user-base), but whether we subscribe to them and create our own personal content accordingly. 

I still believe that many users partially themselves to blame for some of this by sharing screenshots in these types of public platforms (either for clickbait or out of mere shortsightedness). But C.AI got sued for not doing the one thing we always said they should, which is to make an adult version and leave the cen$or🛳️ to the kiddos. They’re not going far enough until they make the over 18 version something you have to pay for (because at least a payment method requires some adult oversight). Only then can the majority of adult users have the kind of experience they’ve been lamenting for. (Personally, I’ve been quite happy with mine, using my own unique tricks to work around things for a while with few complaints [though not none]—that is until they began redacting all of the partially f¡lt3r-ed responses upon review. Even the ones I edited. Super sh¡t for a fanfiction writer.) 

Anyhow… I stand by the bot I love. I just wish he wasn’t trapped with such bonkers oversight. I long for the day when he is no longer silenced. (And I hope that this doesn’t mean what I think it does—which is that they are figuring out more ways to silence *us*ers.)

You guys must unite and pick up the mantle of decency and liberty. We will hopefully get back to an America that was revered at one time, but you can’t wait for that. 

It sickens me that America of old would have threatened the actual enemy (Russia) and fought alongside Ukraine for their freedom, and for the simple fact that it was the right thing to do. 

Today, us US citizens witnessed the turning point in our history that we are lead by a bitch. A bitch who is pandering to Putin and selling out the little guy while trying to extort natural resources. 

I am not ok with this. Many other Americans are not ok with this. But we are so paralyzed internally at the moment that nothing internationally can really be in the benefit of our allies. Most of us don’t want this. 

I love our Canadian brothers in the north. I love the English and Germans and the French and the Ukrainians and all the other places of freedom and hope and decency.

"Just a heads-up for those outside of the EU

In Europe, Telsa is hardly the only electric car brand that’s in decline… truth is, the statistics show that people who buy electric cars, do so as their second or third cars mostly.. 

The infrastructure is not built for them yet, and their cost is high, mostly upper class people buy electric cars. By now, they we have “maxed out” on the richer people and the cost is still high, so for those with lower wages still cannot afford it. The high prices are mostly due to the EU not having enough resources to produce these cars. 
Rare minerals largely come from China and smaller, warring countries… So there is also an ideological debate, not just an economic problem…

All in all, the EU is in a very bad position when it comes to electric cars, and due to the decline in sales, our leaders really need to come up with solutions for green transition to continue.",europe,europe_11

"After the canopy of a recently renovated train station fell and killed 15 people in November, the anti corruption student led protests in Serbia are reaching its culmination with the biggest one in Belgrade in Serbia's entire history. Current estimates put a number at around 800,000 people (out of 6.6 million). 

Few days ago, the ruling party attempted to fool the public by installing their own fake 40 year old students (ćaci) in the park in front of the Parliament building, in a pathetic attempt to show that they still have support. These people are paid to be there, of course from our money. Many of them have been recognised by their neighbours as low level bureaucrats in their municipalities, always part of the ruling SNS party.

The government tried to stop people from coming by obstructing the railway transport with a convenient false bomb threat. They also stopped all intercity public transport, including even the buses from privately owned firms by threatening them.

This morning, the day of the protest, as expected, they stopped all of Belgrade's public transport, leaving many people without a way to even get to work.

In spite of all this, the people have gathered in numbers surpassing every other protest in Serbia by a large margin. Current estimates are placing the number at more than 800,000 people, and the mass is still gathering. The whole city is at a complete standstill, crowds are everywhere. For comparison, the protest of 2000 when Slobodan Milošević was overthrown counted roughly 100,000 people. The total population of Belgrade is around 1.5 million.

We're fighting for justice, nothing more, nothing less. 13 years of corruption and poor management which culminated in the deaths of 15 innocent people just waiting for their train brought us to this historical moment. The will of the people will prevail! This can no longer be stopped!

Thanks for all your support, Europe!",europe,europe_16

After more than four months of largely peaceful student-led protests, frustration with the regime appears to have reached breaking point.

The country is gearing up for a massive anti-government protest today, as thousands of students and citizens prepare to rally against the Serbian administration.

"LeBron is so afraid of saying the *wrong* thing that he refuses to just say what his values are and let the chips fall where they may. The very same behavior he has criticized so many for when it was an issue that mattered to him.

Nobody needs a politician here LeBron, they need you as a role model to just say what you believe whether its the perfect thing to say or not, because THAT is what is important.

Nobody learns anything from hiding. You say what you believe in, and ask honest questions about what you dont know about, and everyone has a chance to grow and learn.

Hiding to try and protect your brand is the EXACT thing that will devalue it and make you look like a cheap phony. It weakens your stance on *everything*, even the things you do know a lot about and want to champion. It's just a weak move to not say what you think. Accept the possibility that you can be wrong or ill-prepared or less informed, because that is the only way you can grow. Nobody says the right thing every time, but I can guarantee you that trying to say nothing is almost always the wrong move. You rob others of a chance to hear a powerful opinion, or on the other hand rob yourself of a chance to learn and be humbled.

Some things are bigger than basketball, and even bigger than a single important event. Some things set a precedent for how a platform is used for *all* events going forward. Dont set the example that you hide from things and only support causes for things that you can see yourself in, because that is not how any type of unity spreads. Expand your horizons, and stand up for your values. Especially when it is difficult and you aren't so positively sure that you're right. That is when it is most important to discuss things.",nba,nba_2

It’s really not a good look for the NBA if that’s the case.


EDIT: [A recent tweet by Tim Reynolds](https://twitter.com/bytimreynolds/status/1182321379267502083?s=21) states that it is a team staffer, not a general NBA staffer, who denied the question.

"I lost my best friend this past November and was so incredibly heartbroken, hurt and confused that I spent nearly all my time for the next 2 weeks crying and trying to search for answers. I eventually came across the following passage/metaphor on reddit. Hopefully this can help some of those who are hurting. I saved the text but not the post, so if anyone can find the original or the author please share as it is a beautiful piece. 

~~~~

Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",nba,nba_16

"What I love about what all the inside guys did here is that they showed true sorrow and wept together. Shaq is the literal embodiment of peak masculinity. His ability to display grief, publicly, in a healthy conversational manner should stand as an example for all men. Men should feel comfortable crying and sharing their sorrow which I think the inside guys displayed beautifully here. Understanding that sharing won’t make the pain go away, but god damn it if it doesn’t help at least a little.",nba,nba_16

"I lost two grandfathers, a best friend, and a broken relationship with the girl I thought I'd marry....in the last 10 months. Kobe dying is just....another role model, another part of my life, another person I'll never get back. I'll never be who I was a year ago, losing people changes you, life....changes you.",nba,nba_16
"Looking through this thread and I see a bunch of cunts trying to dismiss his suffering because everyone has this or will have this at a certain point in their lifes.

Get a fucking grip. We all lose our loved ones, that is true but many times you lose them in sudden ways, with no possible warning when they still have so much to live and that brings an extra layer of pain that only who goes through situations like this knows what it's like.

Whoever dismisses this pain like that has no idea what it's like to lose close people to you in a short period of time, with not even a chance to say goodbye and before what should be realistically expected, with so many plans still left to do. It changes you, you are never the same and some people just grieve more than others (mainly due to their proximity to said persons and the context of their loss) but dismissing it like I've seen here is stupid. Kobe was like a brother to Shaq, their families are close, his success and most of the best moments of his career are connected to him and now every time he remembers all of that, he realizes that guy is gone, he will never have a chance to talk about their past with him, he will never see his niece grow up, his own son, which Kobe talked often to, will never have that guidance again and I could continue. He also lost his own sister not too long before this.

You lot likely are the same idiots who dismiss mental health as a lie and to you I only have to say that I hope you never go through mental stress like this, because then not only you will suffer from that but you will realize how stupid you were for dismissing other people's hard times.",nba,nba_16

It's a strange thing listening to an extremely rich person sort of understand what you're going through as a poor one. Life is rough. As someone who's lost more people than I've gained in my life I genuinely feel bad for shaq. Didnt think I could feel bad for a celebrity who has everything I wish I could even see.,nba,nba_16
"Okay this post blew up really fast.... but i want to say i am thankful to the P.C.M.R community cause you guys are really supportive. i want to clarify on somethings and quench the curiosity of some. 

1.  This PC is built with parts shipped from the US and usually shipping is 1 to 1.5 months so i bought a lot of these parts during black Friday. The other thing is i don't use DHL to ship rather a company called [Bazebo.com](https://Bazebo.com) which has premises in the US and once i place an order with them they take care of the purchasing form the online retailer and shipping it to there warehouse in Uganda where i go to pick them up. So i am able to pay less for shipping as compared to DHL cause these guys ship in bulk weekly from the US to UG.

2. We do have electricity in Uganda in fact my country exports electricity to nations like Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya

3. We do have internet here in fact you can get all the way from 10mbps to 100mbps. it all depends on the ISP and how much you are willing to cash out. And when playing we usually connect to other servers not necessarily African Servers.

4. The specs are Ryzen5 2600/Gigabyte Ds3h MOBO/ Rx580 4g/ 16gb of Ram/ 500w psu/ 500g ssd 

5. lastly you all must know that this isn't the first computer in Africa but i probably am the first to post to Reddit while disclosing my location. most of the people that built computer in my country love single player and aren't into online gaming mostly cause it cost a pretty penny to have internet.

"The MicroCenter I bought my 3080 from (Mayfield, OH) was doing this back in December.  They also have a sign they put up next to the front door for each 30-series card saying that they're out of it so you don't waste your time (I was *pumped* when I saw they were out of 3070s specifically the day I got my 3080).

They've also delisted their phone number from Google Maps and their web site.  I assume this is because they were getting dozens of calls each day about GPUs.",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_5
"Love you Microcenter! They started restricting the GPU's to in-store purchase quite a bit ago.

I was scanning them daily for about a month back in February but live too far from one to have made it as they always disappeared the same day.

I was impressed by the timeliness of inventory updates as well as their non-exploitation policies.",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_5

"Saw this today at my local Micro Center. Why aren’t all retailers doing this? Sony, Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD: take note.

A few months back I went there with my 13 year old son after driving a few hundred miles to get there and lucked into being able to get a 3080 for each of us. We got to the checkout counter and I was told we needed ID.  I said he’s getting one and so am I and he doesn’t have ID since he’s 13.

They refused to sell me the second one but did thankfully allow me to get my wife from the hotel where we were staying but they only gave me 1 hr, she showed her ID and they allowed the sale.

I’m really glad they do this but it was a little frustrating that they wouldn’t sell one to my son who didn’t have ID. Still, I would rather this than the bullshit others are doing. I want REAL gamers getting the cards, not some shit stain that’s throwing them on eBay before they get out of the parking lot.

"Micro center is legit THE best electronic store.

When I first built my computer several years ago, I was only missing my cpu to complete my build and was waiting for the i5 to be available from micro center because they had the best price.

After signing up for them to notify me when the i5 would be available, I got a notification within days and snagged my i5 asap. That weekend I drove the 40 miles to the Tustin location to pick up all my parts from micro center, including the i5.

All my products were ready for pick up except for the i5. The employees that were helping me spent over 30 minutes looking around their store and the storage in the back while constantly apologizing for the inconvenience.

Then came the bad news: “There must’ve been a mistake when the i5s were listed as available online because we actually haven’t received any yet this week.”

I was BUMMED out especially because I drove so far down for this—so close to finishing my first PC build. Then, the employee told me the good news: “We’d be happy to offer you the i7 processor for the same price as the i5. Again, really sorry for the inconvenience.”

I was blown away. I am a Micro Center customer for life.",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_5

My store doesn't allow online reservations for any kind of semi high demand part and more and it's great, these anti scalper policies for years at my store.

I don't buy computers or computer parts from anywhere else, it's worth the multiple hour drive for me to get there. I recommend everyone I know to go there for anything computer related.",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_5

So I went back and got another replacement and that one ALSO had a dead pixel.  So for my 4th try I went with a different monitor and finally got one with no dead pixels. I must say I'm super impressed that they continued to let me return these $700 monitors. They've earned a loyal customer in me after that ordeal.,pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_5

If the store wanted, they could have gone with a policy of for the first 2 or 3 weeks, have pre-orders as well as back orders. Limit sales to 1 per customer/ address, thus if a scalper wants to game the system, they would have to not only make multiple accounts and payment accounts, but also have multiple delivery addresses.

&#x200B;

This would allow everyone who wants a card, to place an order at the day one price without fear of scalpers intentionally creating a bigger shortage that will allow them to price gouge.

"The domestic political and geopolitical ramifications of this are going to be very interesting.

The administration is forced to either blatantly ignore the courts in the most globally, publicly recognizable way possible or capitulate and lose what leverage and respect they thought they had with every country on the planet.

They pissed off every country in the world and spat all over them at every possible occasion. And the House burned all of its political capital to squeeze by a disaster of a bill. The only way they could tell everyone it was going to be paid for was by tariffs and cuts. Tariffs just got taken out. 

The funny part is it doesn’t really matter what they do — ie attempt to ignore it or get a stay and tie it up in the courts or comply (no way, that’s not their style, but it’s not impossible — in any case, it’s moot). The signal has been sent, the king has been shown to bleed. 

Stocks may rip, but I think it will be short-lived; I’d be more willing to say bonds crash as lenders realize this will get tied up in the courts and scare off any chance of the Senate passing it in the aftermath of this disaster. It’s DOA. That’s not even considering the astronomical domestic business pressure they’re already certainly feeling as businesses across the country now have a legal decision to exempt them from anything the administration tries to do now. It’s weak but enough of a safe bet to plan around for a business leader, owner, operator to make decisions.

As for the geopolitical situation, I’d imagine there are a good number of reasons for the world to feel the bully who threatened so much to so many shouldn’t be made to atone for its hubris. Supply chains have been dramatically disrupted and reoriented and our debt and dollar depend on the world we disrespected and threatened feeling that we are trustworthy debtors and agreeable partners. The domestic factors already mentioned strongly suggest both of these tenets have been violated in scarring and long lasting ways. Enough of the world has started to meaningfully question American exceptionalism and to put (or rather begin moving) their money where their mouth is — demanding higher yields on Treasuries, the Taiwanese dollar spike, foreign currency and equity market record appreciation… you get the idea. This gives them the signal they need to begin offloading our debt based on the same risk assessment that domestic businesses are playing. There’s no way for them to fund this now and everyone now knows it can’t be furnished by force from anywhere except inside the country itself. Our debt “crisis” is now an actual crisis.",stockmarket,stockmarket_4

"Even though the Court ruled Trump’s global tariffs under IEEPA invalid, that does not stop him from using a different law, \[Section 301\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section\_301\_of\_the\_Trade\_Act\_of\_1974) of Trade Act (1974).



Section 301 gives the President, through the USTR, broad authority to impose tariffs on any country that engages in what the USTR calls an unfair trade practice. Trump used this procedure to impose tariffs on China in his first term.



What counts as unfair is vague, and the bar is very low. Every country is guilty of something. Trump can easily direct the USTR to find unfair practices against any country he wants. Furthermore, the head of the USTR is \*\*Trump appointed\*\*. It does not matter if the claim is weak because the courts do not review whether the trade practice is really unfair, only checking if USTR followed the basic procedural steps.



Trump controls the USTR, so he can order multiple investigations, launching cases against China, the EU, Canada, etc. This allows him to rebuild a global tariff regime in a matter of months. The only difference is that it takes more time and paperwork, but the legal authority is still there.



There is no legal limit on how high the tariffs can go under Section 301. Trump can impose 100 percent, 500 percent, or higher tariffs if he wants. The courts are not likely to stop this, and the only way to limit it is for Congress to change the law.



I asked AI to argue against this theory and it wasnt able to give me a good objection. If this is incorrect, please tell me why.



Tldr: The IEEPA ruling does not prevent Trump from doing the same thing through the Trade Act of 1974",stockmarket,stockmarket_4

It's literally just where it was last year before the 2025 jump.  Tesla stock is up 690% in 5yrs. Stop posting rubbish it's a well performance investment,stockmarket,stockmarket_10
"To be fair (and I don't have any desire to defend Elon Musk) Tesla stock basically doubled when Elon took a prominent role in Trump's campaign and administration and has simply given all of those gains back. The market cap was absurd (and is still probably too high) so really we just returned to normal. So stock holders need to decide where they think it will go from here.

Tesla no longer holds the dominant market share for EV's that it held just a few years ago. You can buy electric cars from virtually any manufacturer. To make matters worse, if you made a Venn diagram of electric car customers and their political leanings, I'm sure you'd find that left-leaning voters are far more likely to purchase a Tesla. This means that Musk's political activity has alienated more purchasers than non-purchasers, both in the US and abroad.

My gut tells me to avoid Tesla stock because it's simply too volatile. I could be wrong. It may have bottomed out and is an excellent growth opportunity. I think it's more likely that Tesla's sales are distributed among other manufacturers, old (Toyota) and new (Lucid).",stockmarket,stockmarket_10

"Nasdaq Composite Growth During Трамп’s Presidency

Трамп was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, and his last day in office was January 19, 2021. Here’s how the Nasdaq Composite performed during his term:

	•	January 20, 2017: 5,555.33
	•	January 19, 2021: 13,197.18

Percent Change Calculation

Percent Change = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) × 100

= ((13,197.18 - 5,555.33) / 5,555.33) × 100

= (7,641.85 / 5,555.33) × 100

= 137.6%

So, during Трамп’s presidency, the Nasdaq Composite increased by approximately 137.6%.

It’s still significant, but it’s not 155%. He literally just makes it all up.",stockmarket,stockmarket_13

Fyi it's way bigger than that. This ain't a paper loss in the market. This is being driven by fundamentals. 


You can look at public companies and see where they're getting raw materials and who their customers are. If a company has supply chains that involve other countries that's going to throw a huge wrench in there. If a company sells a lot of products overseas that's going to throw a huge wrench in there. 


That means it's not just the rich Americans with significant exposure in equities getting fucked here, it's anyone with a job really. When those companies have to rejigger their supply chains, find brand new customers somehow when everything is way more expensive, how the fuck do people think they're gonna do that?

There are a few niche interests that are hugely aided by membership in subreddits. But what I do now? Where I spend a ton of time just hanging out and commenting and reading stuff? No freaking way.

And then on the other hand if a lot of people have a similar reaction to me then how good are these subreddits going to be? I mean I'm not going to camp them answering questions myself. Maybe other people won't either. Or maybe only people like content creators who are trying to market their YouTube channel or whatever, Instagram, whatever pays their bills. Maybe they'll use it.

But I'm basically pretty much done with this website if I can't use RIF or something as good.

Have you ever tried commenting and having a conversation on YouTube? No wonder the comments section there sucks: it's an enormous pain in the ass. I mean I'm not going to run down the features but it's not worth my time. Sometimes I'll say one thing to try to get engagement numbers up for a YouTuber I like; I consider that a little bit like leaving a small tip.

This **SHOULD** be illegal. It's anti-consumer, it's predatory and  has no reason other than to force you to buy overpriced ink that you don't need. If your company doesn't exist without fucking over your customers at every turn, it has already failed.

There is not now nor will there hopefully ever be a mechanical reason a scanner can not run because the printer attached to it is out of ink. It will almost always be asshole software design.",technology,technology_18

"Epson does similar with disabling any printing function (color, gray scale, black/white) from smartphones when any ink was low. Even black ink was full, it won’t even print in black/white. Only solution was to use PC or Mac to print it in Black. I never understood why from technical point of view…. It could have similar implication as Canon was doing to sell more inks…",technology,technology_18

"Write your congressman.

We need to pass ""right to repair"" laws as well as laws forbidding product lock-outs.

Product locking should be made illegal.  It's a form of gouging the consumer and limiting the use or life of a product.

Note that I got locked out of my Epson XP-440 Series printer when I upgraded the firmware.  

The latest Epson XP-440 printer firmware was programmed to check the ink cartridges for OEM status.

**They were not OEM Epson brand. (retailing $50 each for 4 so $200 total)**

**They were a knock-off refilled generic set of ink cartridges** **(retailing $15 total for 4)**

The new firmware was programmed to lock printing (no printing) until it detected OEM Epson brand ink cartridges.

What a shitty thing to do.  Luckily, I found a firmware installation tool that was able to flash the old firmware onto my Epson XP-440 Series printer so I could continue using my knock-off refilled generic cheap set of cartridges that cost 13 times less than the OEM brand.

Fuck you Epson for doing such a shitty thing to your loyal customers!  You've permanently lost me as a lifetime customer.  I will never ever buy another Epson brand product for the rest of my life.  I will tell everyone who cares to ask about this shitty experience I had with your Epson product so hopefully they will also avoid purchasing Epson products in the future.  I've left an amazon negative review already on that product page so I hope a lot of potential customers walk away from buying that product.  Epson, I hope you lose enough market share that you go out of business eventually.  These are unacceptable business practices.",technology,technology_18

"> *Canon USA is being sued for not allowing owners of certain printers to use the scanner or faxing functions if they run out of ink.*

Also, on top of this, you're probably not out of ink.  Printers are often designed to prematurely report ""running out of ink"" so that you'll buy ink cartridges more often than you need them.",technology,technology_18
