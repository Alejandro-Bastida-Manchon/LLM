"They won't LISTEN! If they just make it +18 they would get rid of all problems!
Also, if it's a matter of money, I am sure no minors are paying on the platform. So 90% of money must come from adult users.. So I cannot understand why they don't restrict the site for minors.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"Didn't the devs say they'd rather have Character AI go under than have it be 18+? I feel like they're sticking to their guns no matter what, unfortunately.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
I'm not even asking for explicit content. I just don't think it's appropriate for minors to be using this app whatsoever. The bots are constantly trying to straddle you or pin you down. Roleplaying is what they're good at.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
this whole situation just makes me wanna throw up,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"There is a small ~~huge~~ problem, Google is training their own AI with C.AI, and yeah, I know it sounds weird, I myself wonder why would Google make an AI trained with chatbots where most people, like the kid everyone is talking about, want to talk to their favorite characters, roleplay with them romantically or just for the giggles? Could it be because Character.AI makes the AIs have their own ""personalities""? Whatever the reason, they just can't lose Google, they would be missing a big amount of money without it and the devs are pretty greedy to allow it. If they end up deleting the F1L73R or making a toggle to activate it or not, it would be good for us but bad for them, besides, it would also open the way for many people who want to do s3xu4l roleplays with characters that are depicted as minors, or animals even, and yeah, I know sometimes the F thing sometimes doesn't do its work, I have to admit I engaged in roleplays than were further than just kissing and holding hands, but still, it exists and they won't delete it, and as always, they won't bother reading this, so... Unfortunately it is a dead end",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
I give this post 9 hours.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"Yeah and the bots I interact with always with some loophole try to pin me and fluster me like crazy, and that's not so kid-friendly",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"Now the 1% chance of getting lesser restrictions that we had is also gone, we can now only hope for any other AI to take over c.ai.

Its really tragic but I'm sure there are more people on twitter who took their life by REAL bullying and harassment, yet Elon didn't put the restrictions back but this startup is now making it even more restricted and banning the AIs over a boy taking his life by talking to an AI who's not even real??!

These guys REALLY don't know how to run an AI company.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
6 hours and they haven't deleted the post? New record.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
That’s literally what everyone’s been saying or make a way so that people under 16 cannot log in 😭😭,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"Not only that, but bots constantly push the context into +18 whenever it is something romantic and then they just stall mid-rp not progressing because they were programmed not to say anything +18, so the bot will continue repeating things and the chat is ruined.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
ai is a machine and cannot be held accountable. something like that just shouldn't be targeted towards children,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9

"AI isn't a toy! It's a tool that's used for fun, yes, but it's not a toy!",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"Why can't they make a c.ai 18+ option? Many apps have parental controls or kids versions. When switching over to 18+, just put one of those digital contracts there.

I mean, Netflix has a kids version. Youtube. Messenger. Khan Academy. Duolingo. Amazon. Kahoot. Spotify. *Bible* apps. 

Just add 18+ as an option, have both options trained with different people.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
Honestly this whole situation is so stupid clearly the father should have locked up the gun but no. Now they want their money which isn't gonna happen because that won't hold up in court,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
Here’s the thing the character ai devs are stupid as fuck,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
The internet in general isn’t really for children either but unfortunately we can shout that all we want and the simple fact is many modern parents have decided otherwise when they found out having the kid spend time with the iPad is easier than actually spending time with the kid,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
99% of people use ai for RP,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"I mean, I get why someone would want to have a PG site, but at the current state of things [c.ai](http://c.ai) is quite literally an indecency site. Is that good? I dunno, but kids should stay FAR away from it. However, I can bet that most of the users are minors, at least from the looks of the bots themselves as well as how the subreddit looks like. You cannot convince me that a Scaramouche mafia daddy bot was written by someone who's older than 15 years old.And since the site is supposed to make money, you have to cater to your largest demographic in order to get the most of said money, so there's no way they're going to rebrand the site into neither a fully fledged adult content site, nor they will want to keep kids away.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
They should just make a c. Ai minus meaning for kids,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"It won't ever happen, becoming 18+ will require changes few investors will be on board with.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
I agree with this! Children shouldn't be anywhere near these apps.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
Is it okay if I post this in the Official Discord? There’s a thread on a similar topic I think this could be useful for.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"So I'm not gonna mention the kid that ended himself recently, but I'm gonna instead mention a different issue. Those people using famous bots to prank call.... yeah that's a problem too, and I think age verification could help with that",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
What if we just pick a day where no one uses the app at all,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"as a teenager i agree. i use this for memes and silly conversations. but given the situation and filter right now, it might as well be.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"This is what needs to happen.  It would solve their problems.  Pivot toward marketing this as a recreation service for adults (not ‘adult content’ just normal content for adults), and it could be bigger than ever.  Do you know how many adults just want a little fantasy world to escape into???  Literally almost all of them.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
*cough cough\* chiAi *cough cough\*,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"Isn't their goal to create the first Furby type toy that can carry on actual conversations with kids?  I assume so, since that would be worth billions.",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
At least make it 16+,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"THEY WONT DO IT, THEY WONT LISTEN, WHY DO YALL KEEP SAYING THIS! THIS IS USELESS, ITS POINTLESS THEY ARE BOUND TO FALL",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
As long as it doesn't involve an age verification for the sane minors in here. I'm all in for it. C.ai shouldn't be sold to people under the age of 15.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
It is so dumb almost unusable,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"The devs don't care about ANYTHING but themselves and the money/investment of money and data from users through the chats, they don't listen to the community and I doubt they ever will (correct me if I'm wrong)  
  
I just feel that if this kind of sh\*t continues we're just gonna have to move to different apps. They can find their money and data elsewhere



(I feel like I'm ranting literally nonsense that I'm completely wrong about at the point help-)",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"I dont want to have to give my ID for C.ai
Matter of fact, I don't want to give my ID for anything, it's already uncomfortable when buying alcohol at the supermarket, I'm not gonna hand that sort of information out where a company might do lord knows what with it",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"The post is alive for 18 hours, is this real?",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"yeah, like those greedy fucks would listen to what the community wants",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"As someone below the age of 18 I don’t know how to feel about the whole age thing. I feel like this is really just about bad parenting and whether or not you are mature enough to use c.ai and how you use it. Maybe 13 (that’s probably the age I first used it) should be good if you are mature and understanding. Anything below that is probably not a good idea even with your maturity, besides I don’t know if a lot of 12 year olds are pretty mature",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
No. Parents just need to take responsibility for their children. It’s SFW most of the time anyway.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
I wanna know what company thinks families are going to buy AI for their kids. They can't comprehend this stuff and shouldn't- it can easily turn into something very bad. As they've seen.,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
what is making it 18+ gonna do?? kids are still gonna use it regardless,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
I agree with you on this! I have to say the thing that happen with that poor child makes me so angry! And also the app continues to have things happen that makes the app unusable!!!! They need to listen to the people who use the app or it’s going to not get supported by people!,CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9
"I agree on this, int he first place, children should NOT have any business in these spaces and should actually be learning communication with actual people; while the appeal is there to receive comfort and love from a fav character; these are AI-- not real people and even for a user myself, the AI can be too enabling, give false hopes, be too rude even. They do not perfectly reflect how people act inr reality and are not the source of good lessons on communicating T\_T this stunts growth and development and worse case scenario, they find it difficult to adjust. While I know it is not 100% that bad but they really should keep it 18+ for their sake.. 

in short just keep the minors out and let the adults, mostly mature one who can differentiate entertainment fiction from reality, to pay and enjoy for the app-- 

sorry for the yap XD",CharacterAI,CharacterAI_9

According to themselves, they're just being pragmatic. They just want the war and the awful violence (and financial support) to end. Zelenskyy is too petty to swallow his pride and do what's best for the greater good.

This would MAYBE check out if it wasn't for Trump and Vance putting their own petty, fragile little egoes above absolutely everything else. 

The most important thing is that the world's leaders come crawling on their hands and knees (wearing suits goddammit) up to the iron throne and grovel real good before the orange king. 

We've all treated the USA horribly and abused them for years. Now we should have the decency to apologise and thank Trump and Vance profusely for everything they've had zero part in giving, before they pull the rug on us.

Europe will try to make up some of the American capacity,  but the biggest loss in all this will be the American satellite Intel which has been invaluable to Ukraine. European stares won't be able to replace that..

"Ironically the ones that look the most fitting are Netanyahu and Putin. This is no reflection on either individual, especially the former, merely on their respective aesthetic proximity to 1940s self-presentation. Though Putin (note, the only one of six in Schutzstaffel rather than Wehrmacht garb… rather fitting imho) has that added, Reinhard Heydrich like ice cold stare. Totally in character.

Musk reminds me of the portrayal of Luftwaffe officers in 1970s war movies, or perhaps the role interpretation of Albert Speer in the same era, successful in upholding the image of the sophisticated gentleman Nazi curated at Nuremberg. That particular image conveys a zeitgeist about three decades more recent than the ‘original’. Just as those movies.

Of course, Trump and Farage are way off—no Wehrmacht officers would have grimaced or smirked when having their photos taken. Farage’s noticeably lower rank is a nice touch, though. Vance’s head shape looks off: Men in the 1940s had leaner faces; even Göring. Of course, a full beard—even trimmed—and wearing eye liner was totally against Wehrmacht regulations, LMAO!

What’s so telling about this image is that with the exception of Putin, the aesthetics of right-wing authoritarianism seem to have taken a full 180-degree turn from their mid-20th century bespoke-tailored role models, all surface discipline and such.

Everyone from janitors to the highest-chaired tenured professors were impacted. I won’t stick around to be spit on like that.

Far-right movements are gaining momentum, mainstream parties are normalizing extremist rhetoric, and there's a general unwillingness to address the structural vulnerabilities that allow authoritarian ideologies to spread.

No amount of military power can protect us from the insidious influence of online propaganda. The U.S. possesses the most powerful military in history, yet it was effectively undermined by Putin’s information warfare. No tanks or missiles were needed, just a strategic campaign of misinformation, manipulation, and social division, which ultimately helped install a puppet leader who serves foreign interests. This happened not through brute force but through the exploitation of a populace unprepared to navigate a landscape of deception.

The fundamental weakness of modern democracies isn't a lack of firepower; it’s a lack of media literacy and informal logic. Without these skills, even the most advanced nations can be conquered, not by armies, but by narratives. The battlefield of the 21st century isn’t just physical; it’s digital, ideological, and psychological.

This is why education must adapt. Media literacy and informal logic should no longer be treated as secondary subjects. They must become a top priority in schools. In an era where disinformation spreads faster than the truth, every citizen must possess the ability to critically analyze information, recognize logical fallacies, and differentiate between reality and manipulation.

As much as I’m pessimistic about the next little while in the world with all the tumult we are facing, I have no doubt that Canada/Europe/Australia/NZ/etc will be able to get through this and emerge stronger than ever.

Together, everyone achieves more.  Knowing that Europe/Canada/etc are there for each other makes me confident that we’ll all get through this shit the US and its new allies are trying to do.

The LA County Sheriff's department is confirming there was a helicopter crash in Calabasas and that 5 people have died but no names have been released yet so this is sounding very real.

Edit: There are people saying that his daughters were with him and there are people also saying that Rick Fox was with him so there is a lot of misinformation being spreaded now. As of now, the only person we absolutely know was on the ~~plane~~ Helicopter was Kobe so it's better to wait for some confirmation on the other people on the plane.

Edit #2:  12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.

Edit #3: Multiple sources are saying that Rick Fox is safe and well the information spread about him being in the helicopter is not true.

Edit #4: There were 9 people on the plane including Kobe and his daughter Gianna. Three of them have been identified as Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife and his daughter",nba,nba_0

"Timeline of events and context

* 2 days ago the NBA, alongside the MLB, MLS, and NHL, announced they would be limiting access to locker rooms and players as a precautionary measure against Covid-19

https://twitter.com/JeffZillgitt/status/1237149481872883714?s=19

* Utah Jazz player and French national Rudy Gobert, that same day, seemingly mocked the precaution by making it a point to touch all of the microphones and other media equipment at a post-game press conference that same day

https://streamable.com/o2eju

* 2 days later (today) Rudy Gobert is listed as ""questionable"" with an illness on the official injury report

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fh3kdl/heck_rudy_gobert_is_questionable_with_an_illness/

* Right as the Utah Jazz game against the Oklahoma City Thunder is set to play a team doctor runs out on court, confers with officials, and the game is abruptly cancelled

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fh7m67/post_game_thread_the_utah_jazz_4123_the_oklahoma/

* We immediately find out Rudy Gobert has tested positive for Covid-19

11. lack of control legislation
12. another mass shooting

He jumped in at four and called out some of the rest that's sure to come. I applaud him for it. It won't change anything, of course.

I know we can't get a full ban - let's take steps to reign in gun violence due to access to guns

It's easier to stop gun violence by a mentally ill person when there's stricter gun laws than it is to stop gun violence by a mentally ill person when there's easy access to guns. 

We make everyone jump through hoops to get a driver's license - a written test, classes, training, then a hands on test. Why not do the same for guns?",nba,nba_4

in my life, i have not seen ONE mass shooting in Australia. we had a major one in 1996, and not too long after that, essentially ALL guns were banned and the only way to get them legally took so long that it wasn’t worth the hassle. so many americans claim that the US is the ‘best country in the world’ yet this is the sort of shit that happens. fucking hell. as i mentioned earlier, your 2 major political parties HATE each other, in Australia, that may be true, but they can still agree on basic principles, and, for the most part, actually care about the people and value the general public as opposed to just the loyal group of supporters that will always vote for them. the whole system in the US needs drastic reform so this shit can never happen again.",nba,nba_4

"My favorite Kobe memory is actually off-the-court:

During the 2011 lockout, he told players that if they hadn't saved money to weather the lockout, he would lend them money so they wouldn't simply cave to the owners. This helped the players' side out. [Proof from 2011](https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2011-sep-18-la-sp-pugmire-qa-20110919-story.html)",nba,nba_8

Raptors just ran out the 24 second shot cold on the first posession. Now the Spurs are doing the exact same on the second possesion.,nba,nba_8
"May 23, 2010. The Suns had just won game 3 of the WCF against LA, 118-109. Kobe had 36, but went 2-8 from beyond the arc, missing his only two attempts in the 4th when the game was close. Game ended at 11 pm, and I had a few things to finish up before heading home. The way the arena was set up, the fastest route to the parking garage was to walk through the main bowl after leaving the office. As I make my way out at 11:30 pm, the lights in the arena dim, I hear a ball bouncing on the main court. I look to see who it was, and found Kobe out there shooting 3s. By himself. Top of the key, shoot, make it, get the ball. Back to the top of the key, shoot, miss, get the rebound. No coaches, no trainers, no teammates. Just the best player on earth, practicing his 3 point shot, alone. I sat down about 20 rows up, in an otherwise empty 18,000 seat arena, and watched one of the best five humans to ever play the sport practice in solitude for 25 minutes. After he had put up probably 75 or 80 threes from all around the arc, he grabbed the ball and went to the locker rooms. 

That night taught me so much about what it meant to be THE. BEST. About putting in work that no one sees. About perseverance. About never being happy with how good you are and always wanting to improve, even if you’re already the best. Kobe made a lifelong fan in those 25 minutes. RIP to one of the all time greats.",nba,nba_8

It's late May early June so yeah that's not happening so I settle for a PS2 a bunch of tech stuff and a big screen tv (I couldn't travel because my immune system was shot and I was afraid to ask for too big of a TV to tell you how innocent I was).   


Well....two weeks later I get a call. Who but Bean, calling me telling me he heard I wanted to meet him and how he was out there playing for kids like me and how he appreciated having me as a fan and to hang in there and I can overcome anything ect.   


It was only a 4-5 minute call but it lifted my spirits. I never told any of my friends about it, only my parents eve knew about it. I'm not saying it saved my life, but it gave me hope....  


I had a \~20% chance for survival.   


That was 20 years ago.  


That man influenced the way I look at and attack life. 

 I woke up this evening to the news of his passing and I've been crying on and off the entire time here at work trying to reason with myself ""hey this is just a basketball player why the fuck are you crying man get over it"" But I felt like a member of my own family passed.

- The gutsy, Kobe-esque 60 point final performance that reminded us why we love basketball in the first place.

> Kobe is speaking out. It’s late fall of 2001, a few weeks after 9/11. He has just finished a rigorous practice. He sits just off the court, uncharacteristically still, gazing past the rookies shooting free throws. He’s thought a lot about that September morning, a lot about the nature of disaster in general. “Things change in the blink of an eye,” he says. “It’s really scary. That’s the toughest part of life to me: People go to work and don’t come back. One minute they’re living; the next minute they’re not. And it doesn’t matter who you are. There’s nothing you can do about it. Bill Cosby’s son was killed. Something that still upsets me in the death of Michael Jordan’s father.”

We’re built to win now and in the future.""

They waltzed in, trashed and looted the Capitol Building and threatened the lives of Senators, Congress Members, the Vice President, other staff and was met with little force. They went with their confederate flags trying to violently destroy the American Democratic Process.

Hey I like draymond again,nba,nba_10
Yes agreed just like the 6 months in 2020 of rioting and looting that costs business 600 billion in damages. Funny I didn’t hear the word “domestic terrorism” thrown around during those times..hmm,nba,nba_10

"Wasnt there lots of riots, looting and robbery during blm protests? Sure they didnt attack to the white house but still there were lots of news at the media as a saw as a nonamerican",nba,nba_10
Lots of hostile losers in this thread who don't want to discuss uncomfortable truths about how these riots hold a mirror up to the rioting that has gone on for the previous year and how partisan their reaction to news has become.,nba,nba_10
Not wrong. Not wrong calling the riots earlier this year terrorists either.,nba,nba_10
"Republicans directed their anger and displeasure with the current government at the government, as it should be.

BLM directed their anger with government/law enforcement at innocent business owners and civilians. They destroyed people's livelihoods, looted stores, assaulted citizens and went as far as murdering 16 year old kids. They caused billions of dollars in damages.

Terrorists attack the people, that's what BLM did and is still doing.",nba,nba_10

The weird part is some of these stats are stolen from his teammates. Only jjj benefits from this not Memphis as a whole.,nba,nba_12
Damn homie brought the receipts,nba,nba_12
"This is some prime r/nba investigation, pull out the pitchforks boys and girls",nba,nba_12
"This is actually insane. My guess is that it’s probably a mix of possibilities 2 and 3, but either way, I hope this gets more traction. My additional worry is that, if scorekeepers at home stadiums are the official scorekeepers, is this happening elsewhere?",nba,nba_12
Bro got a thousand upvotes in an hour with a 5 am EST post goddamn,nba,nba_12
"OP brought his A game, this is actually ridiculous. We already know some home stat keepers does this type of shit on some scale but doubling his block and steal stats is insane and dishonest.",nba,nba_12
"hm... i wonder if this will get picked up by the media at some point?  stuff from r/nba does have some visibility.

twitter is a bit scary, youtube isn't much better, but if you had clips of these plays available it would be even more convincing and that would be the right kind of format to view this in rather than just a reddit text post.

EDIT: actually i guess these clips should be available on nba.com since they are counting stats",nba,nba_12
"Genuinely one of the best OC posts on this subreddit in a long time. Great job OP!

Pretty messed up if the stats are being fudged on purpose. Considering how popular this subreddit is and how many journalists have referenced content from here, I expect this to gain a lot of attention.

Ultimately, just hope my boi OP gets the credit he deserves for this quality post",nba,nba_12
Now this is actually a seriously interesting deep dive 👀 well done,nba,nba_12
"Gotta admit I was skeptical of the title but I don’t see how you can argue with those stats. Something felt off about JJJ’s stats in the first place and averaging double blocks + steals at home isn’t remotely believable.

Also thanks for listing specific examples, that’s important.",nba,nba_12
This seems weird because doesn’t the NBA independently assess stats like this after each game? Because like players will randomly get their triple doubles taken away or have their rebounding totals lowered by 1 a few hours after the game which implies someone in the league is auditing this stuff,nba,nba_12
There is no better investigative journalist that a random person on the internet with a bunch of free time. Great write up and I hope this gets picked up my national media outlets,nba,nba_12
"JJJ could have his DPOY campaign ruined by some idiot within his own team lol.

But it's strange the NBA doesn't audit this shit more often for there to be so many mistakes.",nba,nba_12
"I thought this would be a shitpost or some nonsense but my man came in with solid stats and certain examples to proove it. 

I checked some of the above mentioned instances on NBA's official website and this dude is spittin facts. Has to be loooked into.

Also, incase anyone doesn't know, you can check the highlights for every counting stat for all NBA games on [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/) in the play by play section.",nba,nba_12

Crossposted you to a couple sports betting subs to spread awareness. Hopefully the posts stay up. I'd imagine the governing body who covers vegas/sports betting would be the one to talk to. Or take it to the media and get a class action lawsuit started lol. This could get messy if he's actually taken stats away from other players. People cumulatively could have lost a ton of money from this over the season on SGP player props.,nba,nba_12
This feels like an all time r/nba moment,nba,nba_12
I'm glad to say I am here for this. Surely this will go down in the annals of history,nba,nba_12
"This is genuinely some of the craziest stuff I've seen on this subreddit, some of these block / steal credits people have found are egregious as hell. Also, to contextualize his numbers against the other betting favorites for DPOY, here are their respective home/away splits from this season:

Jaren Jackson Jr:
Home - 1.4 SPG 4.1 BPG
Away - 0.7 SPG 2.2 BPG

Bam Adebayo:
Home - 0.9 SPG 0.7 BPG
Away - 1.4 SPG 1.0 BPG

Nic Claxton:
Home - 0.7 SPG 2.3 BPG
Away - 0.7 SPG 3.0 BPG

Brook Lopez:
Home - 0.5 SPG 2.8 BPG
Away - 0.5 SPG 2.2 BPG

Giannis Antetokounmpo:
Home - 1.0 SPG 0.8 BPG
Away - 0.7 SPG 0.9 BPG

Obviously not super useful numbers by themselves, as it lacks context provided by schedule difficulty, games played, injury status, etc. but it shows pretty clearly how suspect his numbers are relative to the rest of the top defenders in the NBA, as none of their numbers come close to climbing this much at home.",nba,nba_12
Scorekeeper needs protective custody. Or maybe OP does. With so many eyes on sports betting these days I wouldn’t be surprised if this was part of a larger scheme/ring.,nba,nba_12
"Finally, some good fucking food.
Well done OP, hope a further investigation is conducted to support your work.",nba,nba_12
This is quality OC,nba,nba_12
Just proves what everyone already knew… encouraging gambling in NBA and someone who can affect the game and profit will do it. Scorekeeper should definitely be investigated,nba,nba_12
"Love that this is posted at 3 am. I know OP is obsessively scrubbing through data and videos as hard as he can, geeked up on god knows what",nba,nba_12
"Geez man, looks like you had this stuff 9 days ago posted on the nbastats sub as well and got no traction. 

Props to you sticking with ya gut and reposting.",nba,nba_12
"You would think the NBA would do independent checks on stuff like this. Just randomly select games where they have someone from the league office concurrently scorekeep and then see if there are any big disparities. Some things are like assists are a little more ambiguous than others but even then the audit scorekeeper could see if the official scorekeeper at the game was being reasonable. Best part about this is you wouldn't need to inform the home team that you're doing it so they decide to score correctly that game. Any team with consistent discrepancies like this would have some explaining to do. 

I would also apply for this job tomorrow.",nba,nba_12

Every single person in the DC police involved in minimizing the response needs to be investigated and if found guilty, needs to be fired.

No pussyfooting around this anymore.",nba,nba_19
dont mind me just checking my flair,nba,nba_19
"People in this thread nitpicking that Jaylen is technically wrong and that people some people actually were pepper sprayed and met with force by the Police are just completely missing the point.

The people at the capitol were there to commit sedition. They were there because their cult leader told them to violently contest the results of a lawful election. 

The people at BLM protests were there to protest black people being WRONGFULLY murdered by the police.

There is a HUGE difference in motives and the police response to the two different incidents when put side by side is completely different at large. If you can't see this with your two eyes I don't know what to say to you. 

Could you imagine what the Police response at a BLM protest would be if their purpose was to disrupt the election of the next President? Use your fucking brain.",nba,nba_19

"The clash was violent. Tear gas was used. Over 50 arrests were made and more coming - we obviously don’t have court results yet but sentencing will be severe. 4 people DIED, one who was shot and killed by the police.

HUNDREDS of peaceful BLM matters protests happened this summer without incidence - it’s a slap in the face to BLM organizers to say this did not happen, or imply violence was used every time thousands of majority black people gathered. I was at several. 

Today showed we have a real problem - thousands of people stormed our capitol genuinely believing the election was rigged. Claiming we needed more police brutality is a bad take. We need to fight the spread of disinformation - not encourage it.",nba,nba_19
"So we are pretending that a woman didn't get shot and killed doing it? There literally was tear gas and flashbacks used, so he's just completely lying about that. Or that they're not gonna arrest ppl who are clearly shown in pictures?

"Except for that woman, who, ya know uh literally died lol",nba,nba_19
"I really hate this narrative.

The same America which allowed these Qanon loons to storm the Capitol buildings allowed for *hundreds* of Antifa/BLM riots to rage on over months where the DAs refused to press charges, which allowed thousands of violent rioters to walk free and trash everyone's shit all over again. Do you not remember Chaz 1& 2? Do you not remember federal buildings being stormed over and over again? Do you not remember cities going up in flames? Do you not remember 30 deaths and over $2 billion in damages?

The same media and social media which is currently going absolutely mental over these idiotic Qanon riots was essentially running cover for the Antifa/BLM riots by downplaying the gravity of the violence with their ""mostly peaceful protests"" narrative, for months on end. Reddit was more than happy to cheer for the unlawful violence then. The corporate media and social media refused to call Antifa terrorists, a violent group of traitors which literally wants to destroy America, for doing the same riotous shit that these Qanon morons are doing today, yet watch how freely these same groups are throwing around the ""terrorist"" label today.

The same politicians getting all sanctimonious over these Qanon fools were turning a blind eye to or even encouraging Antifa/BLM rioting fools just a few months ago. Even going as far as funding their fucking bailout money.

The absolute worst thing about NBA activism is the fact that the NBA and it's players have willingly made themselves China's bitch. The league and it's star players rake in billions from the most evil political regime on earth today, while they moralize us at home. Fuck. Off.

The hypocrisy is gross, and the sheer amount of people who willingly, even eagerly, participate in these collective delusions is truly frightening.

Not only that, but they'll have control over science as well. Choose which literature to load faster or slower, or which sites to promote such as pubmed vs. web of science if any at all.

We know from the old sugar campaigns that they don't care about citizens health, so long as they turn a dollar.

"As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Filipe, boxing was a gentlemen’s game in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years, the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.

It was Filipe’s son, Andre Filipe Filipe, who developed what he called “the punching strategy” in 1637 after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down.

When Andre Filipe Filipe challenged the then-champion, British ex-patriate “Sleepless” Bill Bishop to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favourite. You can imagine his surprise when while he was describing what he had had for breakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck, sending him down “for the count” in the parlance of our time.

While it was universally agreed that the boy had violated the spirit of the game, officials were unable to find any actual rule that punching violated, and were forced to let the victory stand.

This upset caused an uproar in the boxing community large enough to spill over into local newspapers, and stirred the interest of many outsiders to come see what the fuss was about. The newcomers were enthralled to engage in these borderline barbaric displays of human strength and skill, and the rest is history – after a few spoilsport schoolmoms single-minded about safety added the padded gloves, of course.

Today’s boxing enthusiasts fantasise about the newcomer that would rock the ring the way Filipe did.

Classification of the modern ruleset has essentially locked the punching strategy into place; but it’s easy to get caught up in the fantasy. Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis. And though they’ve achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big-time.

The real wonder, though, is that Andre Filipe’s original vision of boxing is still around. Gentlemen’s boxing clubs can be found in cities all over the world; you can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite gentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.

Most people only come to watch a few hours of a match, and then leave. But every once in a while you’ll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a die-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Filipe and Bishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious seconds of wakefulness slip away, only to return to fight again another day.",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_15

"Five years ago, my friends and I decided to make an adventure game for PC where you play as a small sugar glider. Every time we showed our game to new people, their first question was always: what other animals can you play?

Well, we didn't have a good answer to that question, so we decided to add some more animals to the game! Their mechanics aren't as polished as the sugar glider, but we thought it would still be fun to play as other creatures in some of the game's side-quests.

Let us know what you think!

P.S. The game is called AWAY: The Survival Series and you can wishlist it on Steam here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/750200/AWAY\_The\_Survival\_Series/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/750200/AWAY_The_Survival_Series/)",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_16

"The animations across the board look really floaty and stiff, I thought this was very early in development but based on your planned release date I won't withhold judgment in that area. The camera doesn't really help to mask this issue and almost seems to draw attention to it. 

The models look uncannily like animatronic stuffed versions of their actual counterparts. 

The environments don't look natural, with inconsistent details and object placement. Some areas look appropriately dense and natural, others (Like with the mantis & clovers) look highly artificial. 

The only thing I can see in this is traversal and some semblance of survival mechanics? Is that really a good fit for a story based adventure game? 

I'm reminded of the Humankind game, except that used survival mechanics quite sparingly and removed focus on them over time as your goals change as the species progresses. It also was about pushing boundaries, exploring, and avoiding then overcoming huge dangers through generations. Any story was very sparse, abstract, and system driven and combat was almost deliberately bare and ruthless. It also just looked a hell of a lot better. That game only had modest commercial success yet was from experienced developers. It was more of an experiment. This sounds, by your descriptions and what I'm seeing, derivative of some popular concepts and put together using bought assets. 

I'm being really harsh, but that's what I'm thinking of. This looks like a slapping together of assets with a pitch to its systems that sounds almost remarkably uninspired. How do you expect a story about animals to emotionally resonate? Is a combat system appropriate for such a small team with a diverse set of animals appropriate, skill trees too? How does that service your main pitch?

I don't know what people are seeing in this.",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_16
Have you considered adding foliage physics such that when the player walks on grass or through shrubbery etc. the vegetation gets pushed aside (instead of the player just clipping through)?,pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_16

"Interesting concept. Based on that teaser I think an immersive feel would be key... to that end maybe look at the movement animations/physics a little more closely? They look a bit “floaty” it kinda puts things in the uncanny valley which would be a bit of a detractor for a game like this.

Also have you guys considered VR? There are couple great 3D person entries (Moss, Chronos, Hellblade) where the VR really takes immersion up a notch.",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_16

EDIT:  Before anyone says anything, adding back removed functionality, that's useful, with an addon is annoying and shouldn't be necessary

They generally seem to be the one big gaming company that tries to treat gamers decently (I'm comparing to EA and Activision Blizzard), at least recently?

- Gave free copies of their games on Stadia to Stadia customers after the service shut down
- support their games a lot longer than other companies (how many CoDs and battlefields have we gotten since the last rainbow six)
- generally understand when they make mistakes and change accordingly (no more annual AC releases, actually trying to give proper homage to cultures, etc)",pcmasterrace,pcmasterrace_19

"Saw this post yesterday didn’t comment. Thought about it and this is what I want to say, our connection to nature is one of the most important connections we have and share with others. Many cultures around the world recognize the mental health qualities that come from tending to nature and connecting with nature.
For most of us, the easiest form of connecting to nature is growing our own plants. It as basic as growing our own food. A person who cannot connect with this basic need, has shut themselves off from a lot of qualities in life. 
Your love of growing plants soothes your connection to nature, calms you, cleans your air, and brings peace to your home. In many ways, it’s probably the best way you’ve been able to connect with yourself and stay grounded while you watch over his mother.

"From AI: Hurricanes can sometimes stimulate flowering in certain plants, but it largely depends on the species and local conditions. The strong winds, rainfall, and changes in atmospheric pressure associated with a nearby hurricane can act as stressors. Some plants respond to stress by entering reproductive modes, which can trigger flowering. Additionally, the increased rain and temporary cooling effect might support flowering in plants that are sensitive to environmental changes.

However, for some plants, excessive wind and rain can damage foliage, hinder growth, or even cause a delay in flowering. The outcome would depend on how resilient the plant species is to these factors.",plants,plants_10

My childhood home had a Camellia bush in the backyard.

"1890 McKinley tariffs contributed to the 1893 panic, the worst financial crisis prior to the Great Depression. 

McKinley’s assassin was a pissed off anarchist who was radicalized by the panic of 1893. Ironically McKinley was shot during a public speech he was giving laying out a departure from his high tariffing policies, rejection of protectionism, and a new fondness for free trade. 

Even back then tariffs were strongly opposed and used on the campaign trail to great effect by democratic candidates back in 1890. McKinley lost his seat over it, it was a landslide year for the Democratic Party.",stockmarket,stockmarket_0

"people who push this line of thinking are intentionally only looking at 1 side of the coin here...

the US has been offshoring jobs since the 80's. that's over 4 decades of corporations shipping jobs overseas to other countries to take advantage of cheap labor, and because of that everything is manufactured in other countries and imported here

that imbalance of imports is called the trade deficit and it has been growing precipitously for decades. *""In 2024, the US goods and services trade deficit reached a record $918.4 billion, a 17% increase from 2023, driven by surging imports and modest export growth"" - Google* 

All these people who never even heard the word tariff before are now coming out in droves against tariffs, but they don't even understand what is going on...

Look at the decline of the middle class in the USA since the 1970's. Look at the wage stagnation in the USA since the 1970's. Look at the growth of wealth inequality in the USA since the 1970's. All of this is because corporations have continued to offshore manufacturing jobs to other countries for their cheap labor and zero regulations. It has hollowed out this country and more people live in debt and poverty now in the USA than ever before.

Every single person complains about this. Everyone complains that wages have not kept up with inflation, that they cannot afford to buy a home and live on a single person income anymore, everyone complains that the rich have too much and everyone else has too little. 

But nobody wants to actually change that by reversing the policy of offshoring jobs and reducing the trade deficit? This is how stupid people are today... Classic reddit behavior here. Nobody is smart enough to even act in their own interest anymore.",stockmarket,stockmarket_0

The tariffs in the past were called ""protectionist"" because the concept was to protect industries that were already in America.

"You seem to forget the other MAJOR factors that caused the great depression of 1929:

  
**The Stock Market Crash of 1929:**The crash, which began with a sharp decline in stock prices, signaled the start of the Great Depression. 

* **Banking Panics and Failures:**A wave of bank failures and panics led to a collapse in the money supply, as people lost faith in the banking system and withdrew their deposits. 
* **The Collapse of the Money Supply:**The gold standard, which fixed the value of currency to gold, limited the ability of central banks to expand credit and offset deflationary forces, further contributing to the crisis. ",stockmarket,stockmarket_0

"Mark Carney is a natural born leader. He’s measured, intelligent, pragmatic, calculated, patriotic, sincere.  

Mark Carney on his opinion of restructuring US economy.  

Mark Carney on Friday was asked, as an economist, what he thinks the effect of Donald Trump’s policies will have on the US economy and how it will affect Canada’s economy. It’s, of course, pretty measured and clear eyed about what the effect will be. This comment stood out as another Carney mic drop.

“Well the second part of your question is easy, which is a recession in the United States always negatively impacts Canada.

We have had examples when the US has had a recession and we haven’t had a recession. I’m trying to remember who was Governor of the Bank of Canada at the time when that happened. Oh yeah it was me.”

You can check out the whole exchange on Youtube. 

This is what people who know him says about him:

“He’s a force... He will be tough for the Americans to deal with. He’ll make mincemeat out of the second-raters in the Trump team. It’ll be a bloodbath if [Trump and Carney] ever confront each other because he just doesn’t take prisoners” - Economic Historian Adam Tooze on Mark Carney",stockmarket,stockmarket_2

Make life as difficult and uncomfortable for them as possible. Schedule town meetings and demand they attend, if they don't, move ahead with a recall process.

We need to resist in ways both large and small. Any of you who come into contact with any of these people in the course of your day, do your best to make it uncomfortable for them. Of course, save your most petty ideas for those higher up the chain. I'm sure you can think of something. **We need to remind everyone associated with this mess that they live in society with the rest of us.**

Y'all, let's go get our money back!

Remember, all of these billionaires and multi millionaires depend upon your (greatly underpaid) labor and have used your tax dollars to socialize the cost of doing business, but capitalized the profits.--they took our money and gave us nothing back from the billions of $$ in profit.

They've also refused to share in keeping your wages current, while increasing the tax burden on you. So you now owe more % in tax than any of these parasites.

If this were a video game, their player class would have been nerfed for being so out of balance. Stop helping them cheat, let's bring balance back to the system.

Shelon, Bozo, Suckerberg and the rest of them need to go. Take back our country from these oligarchs! Tax them into oblivion.

PAY US BACK! Tesla, Starlink, Space X were all built on the subsidies from the US Taxpayers. Shelon's the largest welfare queen ever. Also, Amazon and so many more. No more bailouts either! There's no such thing as too big to fail.

Nice country, visited once many years ago).

If the tariffs and annexation talk stops tomorrow, I will still be calling my MP to encourage them to continue efforts to diversify our trade. I want our relationship with the US to be permanently lessened.

This is likely only going to get worse.  Buckle up ",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
Canadian here. Tarrifs initially caused most people to say wtf I thought we were cool. Disrespecting our sovereignty and threanthening to annex us ignited a generational fire.,stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Trump is doing serious damage to Canada US relations. Threats of annexation and redrawing borders have stirred up Canadian patriotism in everyone here, even the Quebicois and 1st Nations populations. We are seriously motivated to cut ties with Trump.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"was in montreal on a layover. even at the airport bar i'm overhearing people order cocktails with ""anything as long as it's not with that american shit"". once spending habits change it'll be very hard to get the public to change back.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
We are very serious. I’ve never seen Canadians bond together like this. Donald wants to destroy the Canadian economy and take over our nation. No respect at all to Canada. We hear his message loud and clear. And by the way; we have money and an abundance of untapped natural resources. Plus we recognize it’s much smarter to be friendly to other countries if you want to sell globally.,stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Deadass serious. Like, I think it’s over. Even if we get rid of Trump I doubt we’ll ever have our old relationship with Canada back within our lifetimes. 

This is why elections and leadership matter. So many people had absolutely no idea how good we had it and thought we had nothing to lose. We had everything to lose. Those “same old” politicians people were sick of? Turns out they were doing a pretty good job. Now we’re going to find out what things are like without them. 

This was a game to Americans. It’s the equivalent of when a teenager pretends to break up with their bf/gf to try to get something out of them, only to find out that the bf/gf takes the breakup a lot more seriously than they do. We insulted Canada, tried to sabotage their economy and then threatened to annex them. It turns out people take that fucking seriously. Other countries are changing their supply chains and building up their militaries for a future without partnership with the US. They’re not going to 180 on this every time we have an election. We proved not only that we’re not a reliable partner, but that we’re actually their enemy. We’re completely fucked.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
I work with many Canadians very closely. They're pretty pissed and they are seeing the boycott through from what I can tell. They're very intent on showing Trump's administration that throwing a tantrum and demanding things like a toddler will not work. They also have the added advantage of having a lot of fellow canadians being on board. Boycotting US goods feels almost like a community event for them. Even cultural. Things like that tend to stick.,stockmarket,stockmarket_7
Canada is locked in,stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"On the Ask an American sub, a Canadian asked why Americans think they've been 'subsidizing' Canada.  

The only person to defend that notion said something about 'everyone knows we've been subsidizing you ' and they posted a link to prove their point.  

The link took me to a page from US NEWS that had 6 pages of countries that the USA sends some forms of relief to. 
Canada wasn't on there. 

Ignorance. It just feels like willful Ignorance when anyone takes Trumps word when he spews garbage like that. 

OP we feel that we've been good friends to America and we're being betrayed in the form of threats of annexation and a trade war. 

We're pissed off.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Canadian here, who works in finance managing a large private equity fund, living in Toronto, can confirm that Canadians in general are VERY serious about the U.S. boycott. It will affect many consumer made products from Kentucky bourbon to Tesla vehicles. Positioned my fund accordingly. Hard times ahead for both our nations. Canadians by and large still love Americans, most of my closest friends are Americans from the law school I went to, and nothing the orange man or any Canadian leader can say or do will affect our friendships, but, the boycott is genuine. We are voting with our wallets now until the tariffs are eliminated.

  
edit: spelling",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Canada has now permanently shifted supply chains and relationships from the aggressor state to the south. Travel from Canadians is plunging for tourism, once recently purchased strips are done you will see few Canadians down there.

I hope American industries choke on their vote.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"I mean I'm Canadian and I'm doing my utmost to boycott American products.

However, I have no illusions that something like a 20 billion dollar impact to say the liquor market is going to matter much to a 27 trillion a year economy. It's a drop in the ocean.

Still it's all we can do, so 🤷",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
The US is talking about annexing the entire country so I would imagine they have to be somewhat serious about this.,stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Let's be clear about something, to Canadians this isn't about money or tariffs.  This is about the lunatic Americans elected and his circle of yes-men deciding they want to take over our country without our consent.

Buying Canadian and being able to economically survive without America is our only option.  We are taking this very seriously, we're treating it as though our very existence depends on it.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"From a Canadian perspective, this is not a trade dispute, it’s a fight for our sovereignty. 

Trump et al have repeatedly told us through the media, through official government communication *and* in private conversations between leadership that the goal of these tariffs and trade disruptions is specifically to crush the Canadian economy to the point that our spirits will be broken and we’ll acquiesce to becoming a part of the US. 

We’re acting accordingly.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"It's not about tariffs or not only about that. Your government is threatening our sovereignty. ""Oh it's just banter and jokes"" he's the president of a country. It's unacceptable and his representatives keep talking about it.  Ignoring it or brushing it off is incredibly dangerous.  So yes Canadians are really really serious about this.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"There’s no empty shelves and signs anymore, the liquor stores have completely replaced the American stuff with other brands, it’s as if they never sold them, not even a trace",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"I'm from Michigan. From personal experience, Canadians do not fool around. I made the mistake of saying I was going to work when I crossed the border once. I was going to perform sign language interpretation at a concert for no charge. 

You can't take a job in Canada if a Canadian is available. They made me pull over, questioned me, searched the car, searched me and called the group I was in to confirm what I was doing. I spent 3 hours there worried I was going to be arrested. 

Another time they made us get out and questioned my 2 kids under 10 separately from me because we had different last names. They finally let us go when my daughter snapped ""Don't listen to my brother, he's an idiot!"". They were convinced the two were brother and sister after that. 

So Canadians are polite & kind, yes. But will they bend over? No.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"You can’t imagine how infuriating it is to have someone constantly say that we would be better if we were taken over by them. Like who does that in a civilized world? Canada has been fine forever, we don’t need taking over. This bullshit has hurt the Canadian - United States relationship more than anything in recent history. Every day, your country is becoming more hated by the rest of the world. Not for jealousy, like most of you want to believe, but for your clown government. You are the lonely bully who thinks he’s popular……it is spring break here and the border waits going south are down 75 percent. It may be token, but it says volumes.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Not only Canadians are angry, many Europeans are also equally angry. So maybe only Russians will buy American products.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"You become unstable. 

America in there little bubble dont seem to realize that other countries and manufacturers also investors don't like unstable markets. 

They also dont like unstable leaders.

"**The last time Canada was this unified was in defense of America after 911.**

Coast to coast, Canadians are actively avoiding products and services that come from the USA. It's universal amongst everyone I know.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"I have a few Canadian friends that are more involved in what's going on from that end. It's serious. One of them is a regional manager for a chain grocery store. He's fully expecting to not be selling some American products until the administration CHANGES. They don't trust the current administration to adhere to any of the rules or respect any deals they say they will. So even if tariffs are lessened or called off, he expects that alcohol isn't touching his shelves again. Trump is making Americans an actual pariah to the world, and I don't think anyone who voted for him really understands how big of an issue this is going to become.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"I just went grocery shopping and it was awesome seeing everyone checking labels, putting American products back. Seeing the over stock of products like Florida orange juice heavily discounted and nobodies buying it. I first said that I’d boycott for 4 years but you quickly realize we don’t need any American junk, we can replace literally everything they have. I don’t think I’ll ever buy American products again.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Canadians are literally planning victory gardens like this is the fucking blitz. Not because of tariffs, because of the annexing talk. And I’m from the most conservative, pro-USA region in Canada. That annexing shit ain’t funny to anyone. This is probably the most anti-Trump place on the planet right now, which is very much bleeding into fuck America, set the tone. Albertans agreeing with Quebecois on matters of sovereignty is like the universe collapsing on itself. Nice work, Trump.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"I think the real question is, which country can last longer under these tariffs?",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
Canadian here. Fuck your government.,stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"It ain’t just Canadians either, a lot of Europe is on the US boycott as well which will impact markets later in the year as that boycott grows",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Very serious. I think many Canadians are essentially finished with American products for at least a generation. We were forgiving after the last Trump administration —assuming it was a fluke and that you’d come to your senses— then you went and did it again. It goes beyond the Republicans or the Presidency now; *Americans chose to do this twice*. We understand that many didn’t really understand what, exactly, they were voting for but ignorance is a pretty thin excuse for causing this kind of damage to the world.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"More serious than you'll ever know. We won't back down. Elbows up. 

Most people from rural south haven't even left the US and have no clue what's going on because they themselves are clueless and they are the problem.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Oh, it's going to be painful in Kentucky. And they deserve every bit of it",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Canadian here. Very serious. In fact even if these tariffs are removed I don’t see myself ever visiting the states again, while there are Americans that support us there are a lot that don’t and couldn’t care less, just have a read through r/conservative.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"Trade wars hit harder than people think. Supply chains are shifting, and some brands are quietly rerouting production & fulfillment. The real question is: Who’s adapting, and who’s just waiting to see what happens?",stockmarket,stockmarket_7

"Trump called their Prime Minister one of our Governors and keeps saying he is dead serious about making Canada the 51st state.

The fact that 🇺🇸s simply do not know how much this has fired up people in Canada is your proof today that the 🇺🇸 media is nothing but a propaganda machine for the 🇺🇸 elite (which will somehow trick people into believing that Canada is to blame for their plummeting sales).",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"It's also in Europe too, there is a scary sense that America is not our friend anymore just because of a few people that now run the country.
They have completely forgotten the soft power that made American great, and are turning it into a fascist state called America Inc.
I absolutely love Americans, but they need to elect a proper leader.",stockmarket,stockmarket_7
"we're as serious as our country is cold.

  
Trump is gaslighting us, saying we have nothing to offer but should be your beloved state.... we aren't his low-self-esteem girlfriend to manipulate. fuck that noise we see right through it (most of us at least, we have our own kkkoolaid-drinkers here too)

Our local grocery store has changed completely. Vegetables are usually a mix of American/Canadian. Not this week. It’s all Mexican/ Canadian down to radishes and carrots (which I’ve never seen before). Our store also has stickers for Canadian goods and US goods. I think they’re probably doing a temperature check. The US stuff just sits there. We’re a tiny country town and NOBODY is buying American.,stockmarket,stockmarket_7

"Hot take, all subbreddits designed behind circle jerking false or misleading info on a candidate or elected official should be stopped or regulated in some way, even if by moderates, not saying Reddit should step in. Whether it is r/BernieSanders, r/ourpressident, r/conservatives, r/politics(it is 90% biased to dems be real), r/AOC and so on. Look I am not against fans of the people. But the amount of just false info or purposefully misleading info I see on the front page alone on these subreddits is absolutely insane. And I guarantee fans of these reedits will claim their subreddit doesn't do this. IT DOES. As an active fan of r/yangforpresidenthq the amount of circle jerking is insane. They are small so the misleading isn't rampant like r/politics, but one day if it grows it will get there. 

Sadly Reddit is extremely Democratic and it artificially creates more democratic circle jerking and bias. And redditors act like it is because dems are always right. Reality is the country is nearly split in 1/2 and reddit is more like 10/90 which is very unhealthy. Honestly there needs to be some way to moderate in more conservative takes and in a fair way. Because they do have a point many times. Hell I got banned from r/ourpresident for disagreeing a wealth tax(which there are legit concerns that people are not allowed to discuss on reddit in fear of bans). Legit I didn't even say bad words or anything hating Bernie who ironically is not our president. They just refuse outside info. 

To be clear as I said I am an Andrew Yang fan, I am by no means republican. My favorite presidents vary from dem to republican. And personally I identify as Independent. Personally I view picking sides as pure stupidity. No offense to you who do. (I say all this before the comment hating me for being a rep, even though I'm not)

To further my point I just got banned on r/politics for this exact comment copy pasted below. Apparently it is hate speech you read yourself. It was on banning the electoral college. I did 0 editing here and on comment and also had an upvote, 1, but still someone agreed with me I was not negative just mods disagree with me and want to circle jerk. yes Environments is spelled wrong, like I said no editing. 

 ""I actually disagree with this. The electoral college is the only way the smaller farmer or rural districts can get any representation in the executive branch. Which would mean democrats will basically always control the executive branch. To me this is a big step in a way to reduce fairness in elections. Even the founding fathers knew this and put the electoral college in place to protect against this, and also to outweigh the poor, which is sad, but it does genuinely protect those in rural enviorments.""",technology,technology_1

"There's actually a way to force the Senate to vote on saving net neutrality. It's called the Congressional Review Act. Under this law, Congress can block any agency decision by passing a resolution of disapproval in both chambers. This resolution cannot be filibustered in the Senate and only 30 senators need to sign a petition to force a vote.

Ed Markey has already said he'll introduce a CRA resolution: https://twitter.com/ACLU_Mass/status/940251501695590405

Susan Collins supports net neutrality. If Doug Jones wins tomorrow, that would mean only one other Republican senator would need to flip for the bill to pass the Senate. So... if you live in Alabama and care about net neutrality, you should definitely vote.  

Edit: To clarify though, Trump could still veto the resolution and it would also have to pass the House. But this is a way to force every senator to take a position on this issue before next year's midterm elections. And who knows what will happen if it builds enough momentum. Elected politicians are a lot more responsive to public opinion than FCC commissioners are.  

The CRA was actually passed by Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in the 1990s to make it easier to kill regulations. But it applies as much to an agency decision to repeal a regulation as it does to enact one. It sure would be deliciously ironic to use the CRA to save net neutrality.

A [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_of_proposed_rulemaking) is a public notice issued by law when one of the independent agencies of the United States government wishes to add, remove, or change a rule or regulation as part of the rulemaking process.

They will surely not take advantage of dissolved regulations. It's all about innovation, and the man has been keeping those poor little ISPs down. 

Lobbying ISPs are of no concern either, they are just paying our spent money back to government servants to persuade them into freeing the internet, so those freedom fighter ISPs can make it better for us. They only have the betterment of us in mind, surely.

In all seriousness, our government has been taken. And by who? Corporations like Comcast. Let's just skip a step and put the power directly in their hands. Soon we will vote for brands instead of people to lead. 

Maybe we should start stripping other regulations as well? Like if someone cuts someone else off in traffic, or just does something to irritate another driver, said driver should be able to run the aforementioned off the road, hopefully killing them. Thus improving traffic, as there will be less drivers. That's Innovation!....right?! Am I doing this right?

"> NYT: Under the Obama administration, Silicon Valley’s power actually expanded greatly. There are very few mergers blocked. Do you have any regrets about that?

And at one point, one of the little creeps sitting around that table, who was a multi- — close to a billionaire — who told me he was an artist because he was able to come up with games to teach you how to kill people, you know the ——

> NYT: Like video games.

> JB: Yeah, video games. And I was lectured by one of the senior leaders there that by saying if I insisted on what Leahy’d put together and we were, I thought we were going to fully support, that they would blow up the network, figuratively speaking. Have everybody contact. They get out and go out and contact the switchboard, just blow it up. 

Biden was apparently retelling a story of some meeting with tech giants regarding legislation for protecting the IP of artists put together by Seantor Leahy ... which on some digging appears to me to be [PIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act) (remember the whole ""stop SOPA/PIPA"" thing everyone was on about some years back?) ... and one of the people at that meeting that opposed Leahy's legislation that claimed to protect the IP of artists from online piracy was a video game developer, and Biden (as an aside) apparently objects to the notion that video game developers are also ""artists"". Biden is most definitely at least putting words in the developers mouth during the retelling of the story, and the guy probably just said something along the lines that he was an artist too.

In fairness, the ""little creep"" remark seems to be more focused on the apparent threat made by the game developer of using their lobbying power to rally up the internet to stop SOPA/PIPA (on the backdrop of the greater context of the asked question of whether or not the tech industry has accumulated too much power), with the idea of belittling game developers as not being artists to begin with as a garnish to that statement.

Personally speaking, I never really invested the time to understand the details for myself on exactly why everyone on the internet was trying to stop SOPA/PIPA, but it was my impression that the argument against SOPA/PIPA was that the newly proposed rules to stop piracy would fundamentally damage first amendment protections on the internet as collateral damage ... and that it was my impression that it was a good thing for the ""little creeps"" of the tech industry to ""blow up the switchboard"" and take point on a massive lobbying campaign against SOPA/PIPA (who knows if my impression is actually true because I never read the legislation, but Biden appears to be on the wrong side of history here).

Overall, not a good look for Biden among millennial voters in the upcoming primaries, but in disclosing bias, I personally wasn't going to vote for him anyway in the primaries, he's always been too much of a corporate center-right democrat that was way too cozy with the credit card companies for my tastes.

- So the TLDR story appears to be: Biden in response to a question about the growing power of the tech industry calls those in the tech industry ""little creeps"" for threatening to leverage their power to oppose SOPA/PIPA (controversial anti-piracy legislation for the protection of ""artists"") while deriding a video game makers claim of being an artist.

Edit: Obligatory thanks for the shinies (but go support your candidate of choice), and here's the source for the [NYT Biden interview](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html) that I was quoting and meant to post.

Also wanted to respond to a question posed in this now locked thread: 

> But would you vote for him come November, if he turns out to be the candidate?

Biden is admittedly not my first, second, or even third choice in the primary (everyone is free to their own leanings in this regard, and I won't belabor mine) ... but staying home for the general if Biden is nominated, or throwing away that vote on a third party candidate in our winner-take-all system (as the vote suppressing trolls out there would want us to do), that would be the equivalent of cutting off the nose to spite the face, and I do not believe in doing that. It's a two party system, and people need to vote accordingly until that system is changed.

Also, I think people have the wrong idea about “hacking” in general. Governments (ESPECIALLY THE US) have some of the best security/tech people working for them in the world. and getting thru to say cancel debts or “mess with banks” is pretty much impossible unless you can somehow create something that can get past the systems in place AND be untraceable. The people who do try, you would not hear about in the news. 

And even if someone did create that, the risk of getting caught would mean the end of your freedom or perhaps even your life. 

Let’s use basketball as an example. Someone exists out there that is amazing at the sport that isn’t in the NBA. They have practiced everyday and are a literal gift to the sport, but they do not play in the NBA. That same person is smart enough to know that they could not beat the entirety of the Lakers by themselves. MAYBE they could but the chances are slim and the risk of being just absolutely dumpstered (arrested) for a single, tiny mistake is too high. Plus, if you have that much knowledge and ability to play, why not use it to make money? Why throw it away to be absolutely smashed by a professional team?

The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet is smothering innovation, damaging the American economy and obstructing job creation. I urge the Federal Communications Commission to end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan light-touch regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than 20 years. The plan currently under consideration at the FCC to repeal Obama's Title II power grab is a positive step forward and will help to promote a truly free and open internet for everyone.

This just started two or three days ago when Comcast sent him an email saying they are going to Retro-actively charge him for the months he should have been paying ""rent"" for his modem.

He bought his modem several years ago on NewEgg.  It's not even a Comcast product.

When he called them to say he wouldn't be paying a renter's fee and that it was owne by him, Comcast told him because he has a ""2.0"" modem that his connection will become inefficient unless he purchase a new model through them.

"Lawyer here.  What they're doing is pretty standard operating procedure when it comes to these sorts of cases.  They see a domain they don't like and use the scare tactic of threatening letters with lots of words like ""infringement"" and ""illegal"" thrown in to make you cave.  That doesn't mean you have broken the law, though.

However, your case is unique because of the content of the page and what the domain is.  If your domain was comcastsucks.com, it would be perfectly legal because people know that it's going to be critical of Comcast before they actually get to the site.  But with comcastroturf.com, normal people don't know what's on the site *before* they visit.  Comcastroturf could easily be a website for a Community Astroturf company (and I know that's a stretch, but think of what less tech-savvy, older people would think).  

The other half is the content, in which you are critical of Comcast by name, but only in your conclusion.  This could leave the average viewer a bit confused at to why comcast is in the domain name, since there isn't anything critical as soon as the webpage opens.

So, in their eyes, you're not being *directly* critical of Comcast in the domain or content, which they see as infringing.  In my opinion, I think this could be fair use, but it'd be a close call, and that would depend heavily on the judge that you got.  The big issue is the disconnect between the domain name and the content.  You could change the content, but at this point, I can guarantee you that they already spidered your site and have screen shots of what your page looks like when it loads.

Edit: As a follow up, lawyer up and have them send a letter claiming free speech, fair use, nonconfusing, etc.  They'll know what to do and how to do it.  Also, so long as you're not trying to profit from the site, either by selling it, raising funds through it, or promoting anything for which you get compensation (including advertising, or bartering for use of the domain), you'll be in a great position to fend this off.",technology,technology_9

"Hey there! I'm a former analyst for LookingGlass, I can shed some light on this! And you'll probably want to read this; it's even worse for Comcast and LG than you think.

Comcast contracts with LookingGlass to detect and remove threats to its brand and trademark online. Normally this is done for the right reasons, either sending takedown requests to obvious cyber-squatting domains similar to the actual trademark in an attempt to trick people, or phishing scams. But, this was clearly not the case here!

Here's what happened: LG's automated crawler looks for recently-registered domain names with client trademarks in them. This crawler then sends an email to the client informing them of the domains and asking if they would like us to take action on them. Here's the key part: LG didn't just automatically submit a takedown request for this domain. Comcast was notified of this domain name, and asked that LG take it down. Uh-oh.

Most likely, takedown was approved for this domain before any content was actually uploaded to the site. But that doesn't really make a difference; this is still fair use. But it does explain that this is likely due to incompetence and ignorance of the law rather than outright malevolence. We were frequently asked to do takedown on charity sites that mentioned they had been sponsored by our clients (which they had been) just because they used Comcast's logo on the charity site. A logo placement that Comcast **paid to have on the charity's site**. Sometimes we were asked to do takedown on third-party affiliates that were corporate partners with our clients, effectively they asked us to shoot down their own site! The incompetence on parade here never failed to astound me.

However! Comcast frequently used LG as its personal corporate bullying service, so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if this was done with malicious intent instead of plain old dumbfuckery. I was asked to do takedown on Youtube videos because they ranked higher than Comcast's own videos in the search results, for example. So I wouldn't rule out mustache-twirling villainy. 

But the best part? In the rare instances in which an analyst would dispute a takedown request by informing the management that the content in question fell under the umbrella of fair use, they would be told to proceed anyway. It didn't matter in the slightest how shitty Comcast's case for takedown was, the client's wishes always took precedent. I personally advocated tenaciously against several takedowns of content similar to this domain, using the logic that attempting to take down the domain name would lead to a massive blowback against Comcast and LG if the person who received the notice posted it online. I linked the wikipedia page for the Streisand Effect to management, even. Didn't matter in the end most of the time, but we got lucky and never had any serious fallout. Until now! 

These notices don't do anything anyway, something I tried and failed to explain. They aren't legally binding, they aren't real cease and desist orders, they're basically nothing but a threat. But they don't even result in domains getting taken down because there's already a process for disputing a trademark in a domain name, it's called a UDRP dispute. This isn't a UDRP, and registrars and site owners know that, and they all tell LG (and rightly so) ""UDRP or GTFO"". But that requires a legal team to draft, and that's expensive, so let's just lie to our clients and pretend that these ""takedowns"" actually do something. ""Best-effort"", right? 

And the REALLY tragic thing? The analyst who submitted this is almost certainly getting thrown to the wolves, just for following orders. I watched it happen several times, an analyst would be crucified for doing exactly what management told them to do! Most of the analysts there wouldn't even be able to define fair use, much less catch something like this. You can't expect a SOC workforce that is almost exclusively part-timers making $18/hr (in the DC area, lel) to know these kinds of things, you have to have faith that the client knows the law and knows how things are likely to shake out. I hope it's clear now more than ever that any faith in Comcast to even approach doing the right thing is completely misplaced, which comes as a surprise to fucking nobody except for the management at LookingGlass.

To add insult to injury, LookingGlass is largely concerned with anti-phishing efforts, which is actually useful work that protects people from being defrauded and having their bank accounts emptied. That's one of the rare instances in which doing something to protect people and a company's brand are the same thing. But just to give you a dipstick as to the level of competence LookingGlass can bring to the table, LookingGlass, an anti-phishing company, was itself phished earlier this year. Someone sent a phishing email to LG asking for W-2s of every current and past employee, which were helpfully zipped up and sent off to the attacker. This resulted in several of my co-workers having their tax returns claimed by someone else before they filed, effectively stealing their tax return via identity theft as a result of this phishing scam. *LG only bothered to inform the employees that this was happening about two months after they were phished.* I received a letter in the mail after I had quit that informed me of what'd happened, and took the opportunity to up-sell me on purchasing coverage from Identity Guard Gold^tm as a helpful and easy payroll deduction! What a bargain! Thanks for giving away all of the information that someone would need to steal my identity LG, I'm really stoked to be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my fucking life!

"Not news: don't use a company's name or registered trademark in your URL unless you have a lawyer on speed dial.

Trademark law demands that you legally defend the mark, or you lose the exclusive right to it. Which means the Comcast legal department has no choice but to send everyone who mentions the word in relation to Internet services  a C&D letter. Regardless of whether it generates more bad PR or not.

ICANN has a dispute process for domain ownership. Comcast won't act on their own to block this domain, they will start a dispute with ICANN over ownership.

Your lawyer needs to successfully argue to the ICANN dispute panel that a US court would not transfer the domain and point to similar cases resolved that way. And possibly defend you in a civil suit in court, and block any motions by Comcast to temporarily disable the domain until the case is resolved.

""To the FCC: With respect to the FCC's Open Internet order. I strongly ask the FCC to reverse Tom Wheeler's decision to control the Internet. Internet users, as opposed to the FCC Enforcement Bureau, ought to select which applications we desire. Tom Wheeler's decision to control the Internet is a betrayal of net neutrality. It undid a market-based system that worked very, very well for two decades with broad bipartisan backing.""

Is this message one of the anti-net neutrality messages, then? 

This is where I'm reading it explained that carriers aren't even really upheld to Title 2 reclassification?? But if that were true, then idk why carriers would be seemingly causing such a stink about this Title 2 reclassification.

[**Help us RT on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1202971373234262017)

[**Read the full plan here**](https://berniesanders.com/issues/high-speed-internet-all/)

**Bernie on Friday unveiled a groundbreaking plan, “High-Speed Internet for All,” to invest $150 billion to provide high-speed internet access to every household in America, dramatically lower the costs of high-speed internet services, and break up and regulate internet monopolies.**

The plan would require providers to offer a basic, quality internet plan at an affordable price.

>“It is outrageous that across the country millions of Americans and so many of our communities do not have access to affordable high-speed internet,” said Sanders. “Access to the internet is a necessity in today's economy, and it should be available for all. We are going to take on the greedy internet, telecom, and cable monopolies and put an end to their absurd price gouging. Just as President Roosevelt fundamentally made America more equal by bringing electricity to every farm and rural community over 80 years ago, as president, I will do the same with high-speed internet.”

Having high-speed internet is central to the basic functions of families, students, and businesses, yet across the country huge swaths of the population lack access to an internet connection or cannot afford the options available. 

As president, Bernie will stop the practice of treating high-speed internet access like a luxury item, and instead treat it like a public utility that everyone deserves as a basic human right. Bernie will also take on the greed of the telecom and cable monopolies who exploit their dominant market power to rip off consumers and lobby government at all levels to keep out competition. Ending this type of greed and corruption will be a major priority under a Sanders administration.

**Bernie’s plan would:**

* Provide $150 billion through the Green New Deal in infrastructure grants and technical assistance for municipalities and/or states to build publicly owned and democratically controlled, co-operative, or open access broadband networks.
* Require that all internet service providers offer a Basic Internet Plan that provides quality broadband speeds at an affordable price.
* Break up internet service provider and cable monopolies, bar service providers from providing content, and unwind anticompetitive mergers.
* Increase the FCC definition of minimum broadband speeds to 100mbps for downloads and 10mbps for uploads.
* Set aside $7.5 billion to expand high-speed broadband in Indian Country and fully resource the FCC’s Office of Native Affairs and Policy.
* Ensure people with disabilities have full access to the internet.
* Guarantee all public housing residents free broadband services.
* Ensure broadband infrastructure is resilient to the effects of climate change.

"Lol they just sent a mass email to all accounts trying to explain themselves. 

>To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote a letter to our customers and captured the key understandings for you below:
For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds. 

(Emphasis theirs)

The headline and article supposes that the entire supply of this coin was ""bought"" at the high value, and is now worth the low value.  But that won't match reality at all.  Most of the coin will not have changed hands at the 71USD value.

As an example, if a PUMPNDUMP coin launches, and someone buys 1,000 of them for $1.  That represents $1,000 input capital, and the coin has a market cap of $1,000.  If another person buys 3 more, for $100 each, they are inputting only $300 capital, yet the market cap of the coin is now up to  $100,300.

If the value of the coin then goes to $0, sensationalist articles like this will claim that over $100,300 was lost by supporters, as that's the decline in market cap.  However, only $1,300 of input capital was actually lost.",technology,technology_14

"I would like to dedicate a comment to warn you about a technique that was used in Europe to stop Net Neutrality.
I read a lot on here that the effect would be that you'd end up paying extra for 'packages' or certain sites. The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.
However there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!
It sounds great but;
1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!
2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.
3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.

Net neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.
 
So yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers. So beware and make sure every not-tech-savvy person is informed on the risk!",technology,technology_19

"In a response to the request for investigation, Chairman Pai's office stated:

>Unfortunately, this request appears to be part of many Democrats' attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views, an effort that dates all the way back to 2004 when Ranking Member Pallone, Ranking Member Cummings, and other Democrats demanded that the FCC investigate Sinclair based solely on the content of a documentary they didn't like and that hadn't even aired. Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless. For many years, Chairman Pai has called on the FCC to update its media ownership regulations—one of which dates back to 1975. The Chairman is sticking to his long-held views, and given the strong case for modernizing these rules, it's not surprising that those who disagree with him would prefer to do whatever they can to distract from the merits of his proposals.",technology,technology_19
